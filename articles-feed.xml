&lt;p&gt;This is a second study of this book as we go through it verse by verse in our Sunday School class. The difference now is we have a far firmer knowledge of the New Covenant and the underlying foundational truths that form the basis of our understanding. I pray that the information in this study will help you to have a joyful relationship with Christ and a testimony that accurately captures your abundant life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/blasphemy-against-the-holy-spirit-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. Jesus healed him so that he could speak and see. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;All the crowds were amazed and said, “Could this one be the Son of David?” &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;But when the Pharisees heard this they said, “He does not cast out demons except by the power of Beelzebub, the ruler of demons!” ... &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;For this reason I tell you, people will be forgiven for  every sin and blasphemy, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. (Matthew 12:22-32)”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts after reading the above verse or hearing a sermon on its meaning and applications? Most people believe that to &lt;em&gt;“blaspheme”&lt;/em&gt; is to use foul language or disrespectful words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blasphemy-against-the-holy-spirit&quot;&gt;BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is related to attributing God’s miracle to the devil after reading the passage above. This assumption, however, will cause problems for those who want to question the signs and wonders they see. In Matthew&lt;br /&gt;
24:24, Jesus warns us about this potential problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who will dare to question the authenticity of the false prophets’ signs and wonders if they are so real that they can even deceive the saved, and they are afraid of committing blasphemy against the Holy Spirit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-is-charged-with-blasphemy&quot;&gt;JESUS IS CHARGED WITH BLASPHEMY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be thankful that there is a Biblical example of the &lt;em&gt;“blasphemy”&lt;/em&gt; accusation so that we can use it as a model to interpret its use in Matthew 12:22-32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is written as follows in John 10:30-33:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, “ … The Father and I are one. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?” &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;The Jewish leaders replied, “We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are claiming to be God.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;“blasphemy,”&lt;/em&gt; which is translated from the Greek word βλασφημία, is used in both Matthew 12:31 and John 10:33. In John 10:33, the Jewish leaders accused Jesus of &lt;em&gt;“blasphemy”&lt;/em&gt; because he was &lt;em&gt;“a man claiming to be God.”&lt;/em&gt; As a result, someone claiming to be the Holy Spirit must commit blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. We can broaden its meaning to include anyone who takes on the role of the Holy Spirit, stands in his place to perform a specific function, claims to have the same power as him, or does something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-true-meaning-of-this-sin&quot;&gt;THE TRUE MEANING OF THIS SIN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Christians agree that the Holy Spirit serves as an intercessor, a seal of redemption, to lead them into all truth, to give eternal life (just as God gave Adam his spirit so he could become a living being), a comforter, one who convicts the world of sin, one who communicates God’s will to believers, one who bestows wisdom, one who bestows gifts, one who bears fruit, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, blasphemy against the Holy Spirit must be committed by someone or a system of belief that attempts to play the role of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-can-commit-this-sin&quot;&gt;WHO CAN COMMIT THIS SIN?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are numerous ways for someone to attempt to play the role of the Holy Spirit. There are already many religious leaders with large followings appearing in churches all over the world. They also spread many false beliefs, which may cause believers to abandon the faith they once held. As a result, it is critical for believers to be deeply rooted in the gospel of grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in order to recognize false teachers or false beliefs when they appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most of the Pauline letters, in my opinion, show that the most difficult issue for believers is the ability to distinguish between law and grace, faith and works. Jesus used many parables to inform us of these differences ahead of time, but they remained hidden until revealed to Paul so that he could explain them to us in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-law-and-the-holy-spirit&quot;&gt;THE LAW AND THE HOLY SPIRIT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many passages compare the roles of the law and the Holy Spirit. As an example: &lt;em&gt;“It is the Lord who made us adequate to be servants of a new covenant not based on the letter but on the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.” (2 Corinthians 3:6)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;“letter”&lt;/em&gt; in the preceding verse refers to the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.” (Romans 8:2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For when we were in the flesh, the sinful desires, aroused by the law, were active in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.” (Romans 7:5)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But if the ministry that produced death – carved in letters on stone tablets – came with glory, so that the Israelites could not keep their eyes fixed on the face of Moses because of the glory of his face (a glory which was made ineffective) how much more glorious will the ministry of the Spirit be?” (2 Corinthians 3:7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase &lt;em&gt;“ministry that produced death”&lt;/em&gt; was used in the preceding passage to describe Moses’ ministry of delivering the Ten Commandments from Mount Sinai to the Israelites. This ministry was compared to the Holy Spirit’s live giving ministry. The verses above were used to demonstrate that those who rely on the works of the law to live out their Christian lives may have committed the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to finish with the following two verses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I do not set aside God’s grace, because if righteousness could come through the law, then Christ died for nothing!” (Galatians 2:21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace!” (Galatians 5:4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cross of Christ is the focal point of the gospel, but relying on the law to obtain God’s righteousness can render it ineffective. What does this imply? It means that those who rely on the keeping of the law will not be saved. It is the only sin for which there is no forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/man-born-blind-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
There are two types of miracles performed by Jesus in the Bible. The first are those he performed out of compassion, and the second are those he performed to prove his Mesianic identity. The healing of the blind man at the Siloam pool falls into the second category.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1&quot;&gt;PART 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-the-feast-of-the-tabernacles&quot;&gt;1. THE FEAST OF THE TABERNACLES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This miracle occurred during one of Israel’s most important feasts. It’s known as the Feast of Tabernacles. Israelites from all over the country must travel to Jerusalem to observe this eight-day feast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the feast, so many lamps were lit that the entire city was illuminated. One ritual that the priests had to perform was carrying water from the pool of Siloam to the temple while walking up 15 semi-circular steps. The priests sing one Psalm from 120 to 134 at each step. They completed the final step by pouring Siloam water at the altar’s base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the feast, this ritual was repeated daily. This feast is so important to the Israelites that they tried everything they could to find a place to set up their tabernacles where they could watch the priests travel up and down the path between the pool of Siloam and the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-born-blind&quot;&gt;2. BORN BLIND&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus chose this particular occasion to perform this miracle in order to announce the arrival of the Messiah, who is himself. But this miracle is unlike any others he has performed. Only God, according to Jewish belief, has the power to heal someone who was born blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;Never before has anyone heard of someone causing a man born blind to see. &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”&lt;/em&gt; (John 9:32-33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A miracle of this magnitude, performed at such a special event as the Feast of Tabernacles, with the participation of the entire nation, including all of their priests, cannot be a coincidence, but rather a plan that God had planned ahead of time to announce the arrival of the Savior of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-the-blind-and-the-sighted&quot;&gt;3. THE BLIND AND THE SIGHTED&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from performing a miracle to demonstrate that he is the Messiah, Jesus also used it to teach us about the true meaning of blindness and sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may gain their sight, and the ones who see may become blind.” &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked him, “We are not blind too, are we?” &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin, but now because you claim that you can see, your guilt remains.”&lt;/em&gt; (John 9:39-41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives the Jewish leaders, or those who lived under their leadership, &lt;em&gt;“sight?”&lt;/em&gt; according to the above verse. The law was the only thing they could rely on for their belief system. As a result, in their opinion, only Gentiles who lacked the law were &lt;em&gt;“blind,”&lt;/em&gt; whereas they were “sighted” because they had the law to guide them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can we explain Jesus’ statement, &lt;em&gt;“If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin?”&lt;/em&gt; Because Jesus was speaking to Jews who were subject to the law, he had to speak in their language. However, what he said went against their preconceived notions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did Jesus say that if they were blind, which meant they didn’t know the law, they would be sinless? According to Romans 4:15,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For the law brings wrath, because where there is no law there is no transgression either.”&lt;/em&gt; (Romans 4:15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he went on to say that because they said they could &lt;em&gt;“see,”&lt;/em&gt; which means they had the law, their sins persisted. This is contrary to popular belief throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, many Christians are concerned: does this mean that anyone can choose to live apart from the law? In fact, all of humanity must follow the law. The Jews had the Ten Commandments and Moses’ law, whereas unbelievers have the law in their conscience because they gained the ability to distinguish between good and evil in the Garden of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-the-blind-can-see&quot;&gt;4. THE BLIND CAN SEE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Romans 4:15, &lt;em&gt;“… where there is no law, there is also no transgression,”&lt;/em&gt; which means there is no condemnation. To avoid the situation in which &lt;em&gt;“your guilt remains,”&lt;/em&gt; one must not live under the law in order for his blindness to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can’t just walk away from the law whenever you want. Since the time man ate the forbidden fruit, the law has manifested as the knowledge of good and evil entering their conscience, and thus the world. So, who can elude the law’s grasp in order for their eyes to be opened and their sins to be forgiven?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to the Lord for opening a new path for us by replacing the old law with a new one that has the power to deliver us from sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.”&lt;/em&gt; (Rô-ma 8:2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-who-am-i&quot;&gt;5. WHO AM I?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that you came to Christ by grace through faith to receive your salvation, under which law are you currently living? The law of sin and death? The law that entered Adam and Eve’s hearts, then came down from Mount Sinai and was expanded under Moses? Or the new law of the Spirit of Life based solely on faith in Christ? If you still follow the old law, I’m afraid you’re a blind man who thinks he can see, and “your guilt remains” (John 9:41).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-2&quot;&gt;PART 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, we spent the entire hour going over the final section of John 9 about Jesus’ healing of the man born blind. The first section of this passage demonstrates Jesus’ Messianic identity. It is not necessary for us who already believe to be convinced of this, but the latter part of the passage where Jesus explains the meaning of blindness and sight is very important so that we can live as Christians according to God’s will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This writing simply attempts to expand on what was said in the previous writing about why the Pharisees, and Jews in general, are those who are truly blind according to Jesus’ definition. Perhaps quoting other passages that say the same thing is the best way to describe the relationship between blindness and obedience to the law. Let us return to the beginning of Genesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will open and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”&lt;/em&gt; (Genesis 3:5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the above verse, Adam and Eve had no knowledge of good and evil before they ate the forbidden fruit, but they had eternal life. Where else could this knowledge have come from if not from the law that had entered their minds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“So I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life brought death!”&lt;/em&gt; (Romans 7:10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law, which brought death to Adam and Eve, is the enabling factor behind the knowledge of good and evil. We know that almost all religions in the world are founded on some form of law, including the law that inhabits their conscience. We who come to God by grace and faith should be more vigilant in recognizing the negative consequences of attempting to please God through legal obedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Genesis 3:5, they were &lt;em&gt;“blind”&lt;/em&gt; before eating the forbidden fruit, but they lived, but when &lt;em&gt;“their eyes opened,”&lt;/em&gt; they died. This is what Jesus said at the end of the passage on the healing of the man born blind in John 9:41.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Jesus replied, ‘If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin, but now because you claim that you can see, your guilt remains.’”&lt;/em&gt; (John 9:41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly did they &lt;em&gt;“see”&lt;/em&gt;? When their eyes opened, they saw the law searching their every thought. In the New Covenant, God gave man only one way to reconcile with Him, relying on his grace and mercy rather than the power of their flesh to meet the requirements of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who believe they have sight through the law are actually blind to God’s grace, whereas those who are blind to the law, meaning they no longer rely on obedience to the law to achieve God’s righteousness, have sight to God’s grace and faith in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jesus and nearly all of Paul’s epistles, I believe this is the true meaning of blindness and sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, our Sunday School class began studying the book of Colossians. Since I’ve been writing a class summary to share with class members on a regular basis, I figured why not make it available on this website as well? This Colossians study is ongoing, so one article will be added a few days after each Sunday School class. I hope you find them useful in your Christian walk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What is God resting from? Many think that he rests from the 6-day labor of creation. Nothing is further from the truth as God cannot be tired. He does everything with a purpose. All things He did before Christ were shadows of things to come after him. Though he started with the rest from the work of creating man, he ended with the rest from the work of saving them. This rest began after Jesus uttered his last words on the cross: “It is finished.” It is this second rest that he wants you to enter with him, but you must first understand the meaning of this rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-what-did-god-rest&quot;&gt;From what did God rest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/God-rest-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Sabbath, which Christianity adopts though may be on a different day, symbolizes God’s rest after creation. However, the rest Jesus alludes to is about a different kind of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, since man fell short of the glory they had when they were still in the garden of Eden, God gave them a means to reconnect with the divine. But the sacrifices they perpetually brought to the temples could only go so far in giving them a glimpse of the glory that was lost. The Lord never meant to give such means to them as the ultimate solution to their loss of eternal life. They were only meant as a foreshadow of the true means of reconciliation between God and man: Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus entered this rest when he gently whispered as he took his last breath on the cross: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; But it was several years before when Jesus looked forward to this moment when he said: &lt;em&gt;“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest (Matthew 11:28)”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also to this point at the cross when the Hebrews writer admonished his readers: &lt;em&gt;“Make every effort to enter into my rest (Hebrews 4:11)”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no rest for the Levitical priesthood, as there were no chairs in the Holy of Holies. Sacrifices had to be continually offered for the sins of the people. But these rituals were ended at the cross when Jesus, being the Great High Priest of the line of Melchizedek offered himself, the Lamb of God, once for all for all the sins of mankind. Then he sat down at the right hand of the Father. The work of saving man was finished. He’s made them perfect once for all. Hence he rested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool, because by one sacrifice he has made &lt;u&gt;perfect forever&lt;/u&gt; those who are being made holy” ( Hebrews 10:11-14 )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What more sacrifices, penances, or acts of contrition, are needed if Jesus had made you &lt;em&gt;“perfect forever”&lt;/em&gt;? What sins need to be forgiven if Jesus’ blood had already covered them? If one has been cleansed from a guilty conscience, why the need to drag out what God had forgotten? This truth is asserted in the following Hebrews verses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.” &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;And where these have been forgiven, there is &lt;u&gt;no longer any sacrifice for sin&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;and since we have a great priest over the house of God, &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in &lt;u&gt;full assurance of faith&lt;/u&gt;, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. (Hebrews 10:17-22)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-you-doing&quot;&gt;What are you doing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the purveyors of the business of sins thrive in the guilty conscience of “unbelieving” believers. They, the believers, should put on &lt;em&gt;“full assurance of faith”&lt;/em&gt; to come boldly to the throne of grace, believing that God no longer counts their sins against them. But the grip on their insecurity is strong. Every time a point is being made about God’s grace, or His unconditional love, or the total forgiveness of their sins, they raise their objections: “Such unrestricted forgiveness of sins will give people a license to sin.” They mistakenly believe that the law will keep the believers in the straight and narrow, that the guilt of sin will reduce the sinful proclivity in their hearts. The truth is the law actually arouses sinful passions (Romans 7:5). Its effect is contrary to the hope of those who rely on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the believers continue to deal with sins the way they had always done. They offer sacrifices in various forms. The Jews offered their animal sacrifices, people of the world’s religions offer things that prove their repentance, and the Christians offer their lip service of asking for forgiveness. They have all forgotten, or have read but still been uninformed that God no longer accepts any further sacrifices for sins; sacrifices in whatever forms; be they confessions to a priest, or directly to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-gods-rest&quot;&gt;Enter God’s rest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus is calling out to all those who are still under the weight of the law: &lt;em&gt;“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest”&lt;/em&gt;, while the Hebrews writer points back to that pivotal point at Calvary: &lt;em&gt;“Make every effort to enter into my rest.”&lt;/em&gt; However, I have a strong suspicion that preciously few heed these declarations. Jesus knew this already when he said: &lt;em&gt;“Small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.”&lt;/em&gt;  Few, like the only two Israelites, Joshua and Caleb, that had enough faith to come into the promised land while more than 600 thousands would rather perish than enter God’s land of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would do well to learn from the Galatians by avoiding their insistence in relying on their own effort to bring to completion what Christ had finished:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? (Galatians 3:1-3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-tell&quot;&gt;How to tell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you still trying to relate to God through sins, through the permissible or forbidden things you do, or not do? As these things determine your relationship with God, whether they bring you closer to God or drive you apart from him? If you do, the Bible says you’re living in sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Bible says that you’re no longer in sin because Christ had been raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins (1 Corinthians 15:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole reason God considers you as not in your sins is because Christ had been raised. It’s not because you’re living a perfect life. It’s not because you can no longer sin like a common man. The fact is the capacity for sins is ever present in everyone’s flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, stop trying to rid sins from your life, but instead rest in the finished work of Christ on the cross. That is the only way to live a victorious life, and the only way to live a life that pleases the Lord. And don’t be foolish like the Galatians who continually try to improve on Christ’s work to present you perfect and blameless in God’s sight. It’s done. It’s finished. REST.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">What is God resting from? Many think that he rests from the 6-day labor of creation. Nothing is further from the truth as God cannot be tired. He does everything with a purpose. All things He did before Christ were shadows of things to come after him. Though he started with the rest from the work of creating man, he ended with the rest from the work of saving them. This rest began after Jesus uttered his last words on the cross: “It is finished.” It is this second rest that he wants you to enter with him, but you must first understand the meaning of this rest.</summary>

    &lt;p&gt;Luke started out prefacing this parable with an assumption that Jesus told it in order to encourage us to pray always. My understanding is Jesus was teaching us an entirely different thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-parable&quot;&gt;The parable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/persistent-widow-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Then Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and not lose heart.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;For a while he refused, but later on he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor have regard for people,  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas.’”  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says!  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Won’t God give justice to his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long to help them?  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;I tell you, he will give them justice speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth? (Luke 18:1-8)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-faith-of-the-widow&quot;&gt;The faith of the widow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object of the woman’s faith is a judge, who is deemed an unjust judge in other translations of the Bible. She may have heard of his reputation as a kind of man who &lt;em&gt;“neither feared God nor respected people.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her “faith” in this judge is like this: He’s a very unjust man. He doesn’t listen to the little people. He’s preferential toward the rich and the powerful. He takes bribes. Had I had some money to give I wouldn’t have to knock as much. He doesn’t have my well-being in mind. He can’t care less if I live or die. Unless I bother him so much with all the knocking, he wouldn’t give me a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very typical of a relationship between a powerful figure and one at a lower rank of society. It explains why most people relate to their deity the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-persistence-the-essence-of-faith&quot;&gt;Is persistence the essence of faith?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title “Persistent widow” for this parable was just something translators came up with to capture what they thought was its core message. But Jesus never taught faith in this sense. He never teaches how much you believe, but whether or not you believe, and if you need to define a quantity, the amount as big as a mustard seed is enough. Likewise, he defines the strength of your faith according to the quality of its object, like WHO do you believe. You can have faith that move mountains, but if it’s based on a faulty object, it’s useless. You can have great faith in a chair, and be as persistent as anyone can be, but if it has been eaten through by termites, it will not support you. Conversely, if it’s built of strong wood and in great condition, no matter how feeble your faith is, it will securely support your weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lengthy-prayer&quot;&gt;Lengthy prayer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 6:7-13, Jesus taught us not to pray on and on like the pagans for the reason that God knows all your needs, so don’t pray as if he’s deaf or hard of hearing. For in doing so, you’re making God to be like the unjust judge in this parable. Since Jesus could not contradict himself, he must not have taught persistent, or repetitive, praying, but instead a persistence in believing, in trusting, in knowing the One you’re unloading your burden on. Yet, sermon after sermon, commentaries after commentaries, and even the Bible translators, fall into the trap of teaching this parable as an example in persistent praying. For thousands of years, since the beginning of Christianity, to spend an extended amount of time on one’s knees praying is considered among the greatest Christian virtues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lengthy praying says nothing about a person’s faith. Neither does tenacity, or loyalty. It’s a false humility to cloak a hidden desire for self exaltation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;god-in-your-own-image&quot;&gt;God in your own image&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclination to believe that unless you pray long and hard, you won’t move the hand of God, is almost a universal phenomenon. Most of the world’s religions also share in this belief. Some religion’s adherents inflict pain upon themselves to get their gods to hear them. Scream as loud as you can, and maybe your deity will hear you. Focus, use the right words, have the right attitude, think the right thoughts. It all depends on your prayerful performance whether or not your prayer will be answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle reason for this approach toward deities is they’re mostly conjured up in the mind of the believer from their life’s experiences. The deity takes on the personality of the powerful figure in their life. His ability to respond to their request, his fairness in dealing with his subjects, his temper tantrums and what not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the relationship between the widow and her judge in the parable. He’s hard of hearing, so she has to knock long and hard. Furthermore, he’s known to be unjust, so though he responded to her tenacious knocking, his answers may not spring from his knowledge of her situation, or how his decision may affect her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when Jesus parabolically concluded the story with &lt;em&gt;“When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”&lt;/em&gt;, he was hinting at something completely different than Luke’s introduction to the parable. He was asking his listeners whether they would know God as he should be known, because he knew the widow, who is perhaps no different than the disciples that surrounded him, though may have faith, her faith, and theirs, was a faith in a god created in their own image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-differences&quot;&gt;The differences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to contrast the judge against God. The judge was in a deep slumber. God never sleeps. The judge was uninterested in the woman’s situation. God knew her even before she was knitted in her mother’s womb. The judge may not be able to solve the woman’s problem as the opposing party in her situation may be more powerful than him. Our God is omnipotent. The judge lacks compassion toward the woman. God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son. The judge granted her request just to shut her up without regard to whether his answer helps or hurt her in the long run. God may or may not grant a request, he does it based on his foreknowledge of the plan for each person’s life. Lastly, this judge is hard of hearing, but our God knows the inward groaning of all his people even before they could voice them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-kind-of-faith&quot;&gt;What kind of faith?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus asked at the end of the parable: &lt;em&gt;“When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”&lt;/em&gt;, he meant anything but persistent prayer. Let’s look at how John defines eternal life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. (John 17:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eternal life has nothing to do with what you do for God, for he can send the angels of heaven to accomplish whatever in his plan, but it has everything to do with knowing God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you know that God is not like that judge? Will you know that  he desires a relationship with you unlike that of the widow and the judge? Will you know that God is infinitely more knowing and compassionate than the judge? But Jesus knew better. He knew a multitude went to church, wore the badge of Christianity, but few truly knew him. Most relate to him like a transaction, if I do this, will you do that for me? Since I have done this, can I expect you to do that? But so rare were those who were humble enough to acknowledge that God could do whatever he wished, and he owed them nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great faith may prompt one who is in need to raise their concern to God, then leave it at that, knowing that they do not have to pray long and hard, they don’t have to try to move his hands with long extended prayers, but leave their burden at the throne of grace knowing that all things will work out for them in due time. But such faith is rare, as most believe that God reciprocates the amount of time they spend on their knees. Their god is deaf, our God can hear the saint’s prayer even before it is spoken, their god cannot hear the cry of the little people, our God cares for even a little sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won’t just be whether, when the Son of Man returns, he will find faith, but whether he will find faith &lt;em&gt;“on earth.”&lt;/em&gt; Mostlikely, He will find many who have the kind of faith like that of the widow toward the unjust judge, and just as many who read this parable and draw the conclusion that it’s about persistence in prayer. Will he find true faith on earth? Will he find any who knows him as he is?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Have you heard a sermon based on the Bible quote &lt;em&gt;“many live as enemies of the cross of Christ”&lt;/em&gt;? What comes immediately to your mind as you contemplate its meaning? I’m almost certain most Christians got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

It didn’t take long after becoming a Christian that I heard the verse in question for the first time. Without needing my pastor to elaborate on its meaning, I immediately formed in my mind what actions, or attitudes, would make me an enemy of the cross. Decades later, the notion of what those things were was still vague. Yet, they dictated my every waking moment, caused me to walk with God as if on eggshells. A silent alarm constantly went off, but I learned to suppress it, to press the proverbial snooze button. Yet, it only delayed the onset of the next alarm, perhaps causing even more anxiety. Oftentimes, the implied meaning of the verse spoke louder than the explicit, to gather more under the umbrella of suspicions while leaving me longing for the peace that Jesus promised. Far be it from me to be an enemy of the cross, but being fully acceptable to the Lord, I wasn’t sure. It is the limbo between God’s full acceptance and being his enemy that kept me in a constant state of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;philippians-318&quot;&gt;Philippians 3:18&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ (KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transgressions-make-you-the-enemy&quot;&gt;Transgressions make you the enemy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it some bad things that you do, or the failure to do some good things, that make you God’s enemy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view of the law held by most people is that it is only broken when it can be externally observed, spelled out in some written rules, and had witnesses. Such as the laws against murder, adultery, stealing, and others. But any serious student of the Scriptures should know that the law goes much deeper than that. It’s exposes the heart of man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’ But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Matthew 5:27-28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in effect, everyone is an enemy of the cross, if indeed transgression is the key factor. Then Paul should have written Philippians 3:18 to address everyone, including himself that they’re all guilty just the same. But what would the point be if he did so? In the vain hope that some among them can stop sinning so they can stop becoming enemies of the cross?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-covenants&quot;&gt;The Covenants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two Covenants, the Old and the New, determine the outcomes of man’s relationship with God. Under the Old Covenant, a man is required to keep all of the law to remain in God. After allowing man a long enough period of time to show them their inability to keep all the requirements of the law, God gave them a chance to reconcile with him through the death of Jesus on the cross. It’s a free gift to be freely received as it is so priceless that no one can afford to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The door through the New Covenant is opened, and the door that no one could budge, the Old Covenant, has been taken away forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if some insist on entering God’s kingdom through the old door? They insist that they have some part in the salvation of their depraved humanity? They’re driven by the same pride that drove Adam and Eve to try to become like God, to acquire the knowledge of good and evil. What did that make of them, in their relationship with their Maker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;confidence-in-the-flesh&quot;&gt;Confidence in the flesh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s put some context to Philippians 3:18. Here are verses 2 and 3 which precede verse 18:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no &lt;u&gt;confidence in the flesh&lt;/u&gt;. (Philippians 3:2-3 — NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the severity of the language in verse 2. Paul called some people dogs, and evildoers. What did they do that warranted such harsh descriptions? They are &lt;em&gt;“mutilators of the flesh,”&lt;/em&gt; and they put their &lt;em&gt;“confidence in the flesh.”&lt;/em&gt; This type of contrasts is found in Galatians, Romans, Hebrews, and here in Philippians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul must be comparing the circumcision through law keeping against the true circumcision of the heart by the Spirit. All the books listed in the paragraph above should establish a proper foundation for understanding what Paul is writing about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who give in to fleshly temptation, do so out of the weakness of their flesh. However, there is clearly a purpose when one puts confidence in the flesh. It’s not a weakness, but purposeful action to use means of the flesh to earn God’s favor.  The one is easily identified through the commandments, or laws, the other is more subtle, but carefully, and exhaustively, laid out in many of Paul’s epistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these makes one the enemy of the cross? It’s obviously the latter. It’s a belief system. It’s an attempt to attain God’s righteousness through human efforts. But strangely, and frustratingly, messages from pulpits are anything but that. Their messages are that your sins are what that makes you the enemies of the cross. Few, if any, ever makes the connection with legalism as the true enemy of the cross. Sins can be forgiven, but legalism is the ultimate denial of the cross. It’s no wonder that so few Christians really understand the gospel, let alone sharing it with the unbelieving world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-true-enemy-of-the-cross&quot;&gt;The true enemy of the cross&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two verses below should add more strength to the argument that the true enemy of the cross is not someone who is outside of the Christian faith, is not a Christian who still at times gives in to the weakness of their flesh, but is someone who though may have begun in God’s grace, but now pursue, or advocate for, an alternative to the cross of Christ, or a different gospel as it is referred to in Galatians 1:6. In short, it’s their returning to obedience to the law to attain the righteousness of God. It’s the antithesis of sole reliance on the finished work of Christ on the cross. The &lt;em&gt;“falling away”&lt;/em&gt; in Hebrews 6:6 below speaks of the Hebrews’ return to the obsoleted, hence ineffective, offering of animal sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace! (Galatians 5:4)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;For it is impossible in the case of those who have once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, become partakers of the Holy Spirit,  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;tasted the good word of God and the miracles of the coming age,  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;and then have committed apostasy, to renew them again to repentance, since they are crucifying the Son of God for themselves all over again and holding him up to contempt. (Hebrews 6:4-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gospel-shaped-world-view&quot;&gt;Gospel-shaped world view&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you understand the gospel profoundly affects your world view, and ultimately your relationship with God. A proper understanding will keep you from becoming legalistic and judgmental. It lays a proper foundation for you to know God’s peace.  It prevents you from entering the treadmill of performance, or helps you get off of it. It gives you the wisdom to see the futility of trying to please God as He cannot be pleased except by His only begotten Son; it’s not that He doesn’t appreciate you trying to please Him, it’s that you don’t have what it takes to do the impossible. Last but not least, it gives you the assurance that you’re not God’s enemy, and leave to Him the judgement whether someone else is the enemy of the cross, as He alone knows the heart of man.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In Luke 14 Jesus stated that a tower builder, or a king heading toward a battle, must calculate their chance for success. Yet few who embark on the journey to God’s kingdom ever pay heed to Jesus’ demand for perfection as a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-one-iota-will-pass&quot;&gt;Not one iota will pass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/be-ye-perfect-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 5:18, Jesus spoke in no uncertain term that &lt;em&gt;“… Until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. (NIV)”&lt;/em&gt; And then he followed suit with a law that should strike fear in the heart of all those who aim to enter the kingdom of God:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. (Matthew 5:48 - KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet many Christians seem oblivious to its implication. Countless books and sermons were written and preached in the hope of moving the believers to a higher level of spirituality while ignoring its obvious futility. Most Bible commentaries are no exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of man’s self bootstrap toward godhood is the main feature of all the world’s religions. Repeated incarnations and various forms of self-denials are proposed as a means for breaking free from the cycle of birth and death by overcoming the sinful flesh. For the Christians, it’s some good things they must do or some bad things they must avoid to improve their relationship with God and to have better assurance of their salvation. Most believe their life is a work in progress. They call it the process of sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this respect, those who believe in reincarnations fare better as they believe one day they will reach their goal of perfection albeit through an infinite number of trials. But what about the Christians? They have only one chance to get to perfection before they meet God as it is written in 2 Corinthians 5:10: &lt;em&gt;“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, …”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-young-ruler&quot;&gt;The young ruler&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 19, we read of a rich young ruler who came to meet Jesus asking him what good things he must do to inherit the kingdom of God, and he got the following answer from the Author of the Law:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me . (Matthew 19:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This young man boasted that he was able to keep all the commandments Jesus asked. But this one thing that wasn’t clearly spelled out in the written law took him by surprise: &lt;em&gt;“sell your possessions and give to the poor.”&lt;/em&gt; Jesus knew how to humble a man, especially one who is religious. No matter how a man tries to cover himself with the fig leaves of his righteous acts, the Bible clearly describes his true condition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many modern Christians, the young ruler thought he could achieve perfection through good deeds, but Jesus knew better, for he himself inspired the prophet Isaiah to declare since ancient time that all man’s &lt;em&gt;“righteous acts are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6)”&lt;/em&gt; which can never restore fallen man to their lost glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, though Jesus said people must become perfect before they can enter the kingdom of God, his true intention was to inform humanity that perfection belongs to God alone and he will never share his glory with flesh and blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-honest-assessment&quot;&gt;An honest assessment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are among those who follow the path of progressive sanctification, what is your self-assessment of where you stand along the perfection scale? Have you made much progress since the day you called Jesus your Savior and Lord? How many years do you think it will be before you meet the Lord? At the current rate of progress, where do you think you will be? What if you are to meet him tonight? Will you be perfect enough to enter his heaven?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a teacher who is teaching others this progressive sanctification, what is your rate of success? And even more importantly, what is your very own self-assessment? A pastor likens the effort to rid one’s self of his sin nature to the attempt to jump to the moon. Using this analogy, we might ask: how can a man who has never succeeded in his effort to jump to the moon presume to teach others how to achieve such feat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying your best will not be good enough, and neither will the discounting of Jesus’ insistence in his demand for perfection. Jesus absolutely meant it when he said not a stroke of a pen will be removed from the law. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that they must be completely flawless on or before the day of reckoning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“… holiness, without which no man shall see God.” (Hebrews 12:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-quick-detour-sanctification&quot;&gt;A quick detour: sanctification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theological definition of sanctification is to set apart something for particular use as intended by the designer. However, in practice, the word usually takes on a much different meaning. It’s usually used to include purity, holiness, morality, virtue, etc. Most Bible teachers promote a concept called progressive sanctification, a process in which a Christian must strive to become more and more sanctified until he or she reaches perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on this topic, let us take an honest look at our own progress and ask ourselves: Am I becoming more like my Savior as each day goes by? More love? More patience? Slower to anger? A student needs only take an exam to learn with a fair degree of accuracy his current standing as well as progress since the last test. It’s not clear how we can do this with our spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I and my wife spent a couple of hours on one Saturday by signing up for some classes to learn some skills. My wife took baking while I took a voice lesson. After listening to the instructor for about two hours, I left the hotel conference room without any idea how to improve my singing voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning how to sing is as nothing compared to trying to imitate Christ. Yet the chances I’ll be singing like Pavarotti are slim to none in this lifetime. Hence even slimmer, by comparison, must be the chances for becoming like my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. A man may be able to acquire the skills that make angels envious, but for him to become like God? Not only that it’s an impossible pursuit, but he is also repeating the original sin of trying to become like God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of progressive sanctification is such a deception that robs believers of the joy of salvation, and along with it the true Sabbath rest that is rightfully theirs that no one should take away. Besides, what part of you needs to be sanctified? Spirit? No, the Spirit came from God, the same One that was breathed into Adam to give him life, and the same One that is once again breathed into those who came into a trust relationship with God through Christ. Can you really improve the Holy Spirit? The third Person of the Godhead? Absolutely not. What about Body, or Soul, or Flesh, the non-spirit part of a person? Where does the Bible say the mortal flesh will ever enter the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 15:50)? Nowhere, except in 1 Corinthians 15:52 where Paul tells us a mystery, that in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, when we will be clothed with immortality. This change to immortality, to perfection, is not progressive, but instantaneous, and it will only happen when Christ comes again. Additionally, the progressive sanctification idea smacks of trying to patch up an old piece of garment, our present flesh, with the new cloth of the gospel. At the end of this writing, we will take a quick tour through Galatians 3 to view through biblical lenses the true meaning of perfection and sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gods-will-for-your-life&quot;&gt;God’s will for your life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people think God’s will is his desires or expectations for them. Perhaps he wants them to overcome some sins or character flaws, or to call them into some ministries or certain other things among countless things a believer must do in order to bring themselves closer to where they think their God wants them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a view of God’s will is a recipe for a miserable Christian life as there will be no rest for the soul who has to constantly make guesses and chase after their perceived will of God. A question that might be raised is will they ever arrive at a state of resolution before they meet their Maker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the true will of God is the description of the indescribable inheritance that is sealed by the blood of the Lamb of God for you in the heavenly places. And if he does have a desire for you while you’re still here on earth, it must be this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… make every effort to enter that rest (Hebrews 4:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see the significance of this verse? God gave us many foreshadows of rest only to point to the ultimate rest from the work of restoring man’s fellowship with God. The Sabbath gave the Israelite physical rest, but it points to our spiritual rest. Jesus spoke often of the rest of those who were heavily burdened, but not at all of the physical burden that must be borne by all of earth dwellers. He talked of the spiritual burden that is borne of a life trying to get right with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the final moment on the cross, Jesus spoke: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; The work of restoring the perfect status of man before God was finished. It was done, some two thousand years ago. Anyone who accepts his finished work and rest in it, will enter into his peace. But unfortunately, most Christians refuse to enter this rest, much like the Israelite of old who refused to enter the promised land upon their first arrival and ended up going in circles for the next 40 years. This rest is so important that the author of Hebrews calls their refusal to enter the promised land the rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in &lt;strong&gt;the rebellion&lt;/strong&gt;, during the time of testing in the wilderness, where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what I did. That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, and &lt;strong&gt;they have not known my ways&lt;/strong&gt;.’ So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘&lt;strong&gt;They shall never enter my rest&lt;/strong&gt;.’ ” (Hebrews 3:7-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rebellion was the refusal to enter the promised land, the place that the Lord called his REST, the place where the work of redeeming man was finished. God’s &lt;em&gt;“ways”&lt;/em&gt; is the way of trusting in what Christ had done, not the way of the works of the flesh, or the reliance on obedience to the law to earn righteousness. So God unloaded his wrath against those who rejected his free gift of salvation and declined to enter his rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme of God’s anger against those who refuse to walk by grace is further amplified in the Galatians letter that we will delve into a bit later. Here, let us be reminded once again that God’s utmost desire for us is we fully enter that place of rest, or rather to fully understand God’s grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. (2 Peter 3:18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;galatians-3--faith-or-works-of-the-law&quot;&gt;Galatians 3 — Faith or Works of the Law?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years have passed since I first wrote a study on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vacsf.org/galatians/Galatians-Chapter-03/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Galatians 3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; around the middle of 2015. I have grown much in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Peter 3:18) since then. This second writing is used to provide further context to help discover Jesus’ true intention in his almost parabolic command: &lt;em&gt;“Be Ye Perfect.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us delve into Galatians 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-31-4&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:1-4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law,or by believing what you heard? &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh? &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the Galatians were doing, they acted as if Jesus wasn’t crucified. Because if they believed that he was, they would have lived out their Christian life differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul began by asking the Galatians how they became Christians, whether through believing the gospel message they heard or through obedience to the rules spelled out in the law. Paul contrasted the two means they might have employed toward salvation, and it was clear he expected them to give the right answer that faith, or believing, was the only means acceptable to God. Then he followed up with a rebuke of the way they chose to live out the rest of their Christian life. They relied on human efforts, on the strength of their flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the word &lt;em&gt;“finish”&lt;/em&gt; Paul used in the rebuke. Some other translations use the words &lt;em&gt;“made perfect”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“made complete.”&lt;/em&gt; Paul knew the Galatians didn’t trust in the finished work of Christ, so in their mind, they were not yet perfect even though Christ had died for them once for all. This is the same error that is still being committed to this present day. All you need to do is search the internet for “progressive sanctification” to find the same idea being propagated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-35-6&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:5-6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul reiterated what he wrote in verses 1-4 that righteousness is through faith alone, and all that Abraham needed was faith in God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-37-9&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:7-9&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.” &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you read these verses, keep in mind that Paul was emphasizing faith as opposed to the works of the law, and he keeps repeating it ad nauseam to impress upon us its importance. The true children of Abraham are those who rely on faith and are also those not necessarily related to him by blood, namely the Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-310-14&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:10-14&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.” &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.” &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them.”&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.” &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is really no need to explain the meaning of these verses. They speak for themselves. But let’s go through the main points for more clarity. What does it mean to &lt;em&gt;“rely on the law?”&lt;/em&gt; Religious people rely on the law, or the keeping of the law’s requirements, to get right with God. But as we read from verse 11, the works of the law will NOT get anyone &lt;em&gt;“justified before God.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 12 says &lt;em&gt;“The law is not based on faith.”&lt;/em&gt; It is so because it requires works for justification, and that can’t happen as it is so stated in verse 11. Faith is based on an object external to one’s self, namely Jesus Christ and all that he’s done, on the contrary, the law is based on the performance of the flesh. One puts the focus on Christ while the other back on self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the law is truly a curse to those who rely on it. It’s a curse because there is no rest for those who must &lt;em&gt;“continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”&lt;/em&gt; They must continue because the works of the law will not get them to their destination. These works are much like the repeated offering of sacrifices of the old covenant that could not take away sins (Hebrews 10:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 12: &lt;em&gt;“The person who does these things will live by them.”&lt;/em&gt; These things are the works of the law, therefore, those who rely on the law will have to meet the exact requirements of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 13: &lt;em&gt;“Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.”&lt;/em&gt; Christians have often been taught that obedience to the law is essential for spiritual growth, but verse 13 refers to the law as a curse and that Christ has redeemed us from it. The Bible clearly gives us permission to live apart from the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, verse 14: &lt;em&gt;“by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.”&lt;/em&gt; To receive the Spirit is to be given eternal life. This verse places great significance on how the Spirit is received: by faith, not by the works of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, if none of the good deeds can get one into heaven, how can there be any action that makes one more acceptable to God as proposed by the progressive sanctification proponents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-323-26&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:23-26&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 23: &lt;em&gt;“Before the coming of this faith.”&lt;/em&gt; This faith is the faith that says &lt;em&gt;“Believe in the One God has sent and you shall be saved (John 6:29),”&lt;/em&gt; and not the faith that places confidence in human effort.  We were under the law only until the arrival of the faith that saves. The law was our &lt;em&gt;“guardian”&lt;/em&gt; only temporarily until Christ comes. And Paul repeated it again: we became children of God &lt;em&gt;“through faith.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-ye-perfect&quot;&gt;Be Ye Perfect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To receive the Holy Spirit means to receive everlasting life, to once again receive the Life that was infused into Adam when God created the world. However, in order for God to indwell your heart, one condition must have been met: you’re perfect. But are you? No, you’re not, for &lt;em&gt;“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23),”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“None is righteous, no, not one (Romans 3:10),”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“all our righteous acts are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).”&lt;/em&gt; So, how have you become so pure and sanctified that God could take residence in your heart? Because we all are &lt;em&gt;“justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus (Romans 3:24).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are perfect because we have been justified, and it is by grace through faith, and not by even the best of our righteous acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-truth-shall-set-you-free&quot;&gt;The truth shall set you free&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth about our justification sets us free so we may truly know God. There is no more fear of condemnation that keeps us in hiding, while God’s complete acceptance allows us to boldly walk into the light of his presence so we can fellowship with him. There is no more need to measure up, to scale the impossible wall of perfection, but there is “rest beyond the river” as the song goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perpetual quest of man to reach perfection through their own flesh effort proves but one thing: their pride, because where there is work, there is pride and boasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. (Romans 3:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, then lies the cure for the incurable perfectionist: Christ has already made you perfect through his redemption on the cross. Christ has set you free so you may know him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Be-Ye-Perfect command, or any among the Ten Commandments, or any command that has dwelled in man’s conscience since they acquired the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden, must be fulfilled by candidates for the kingdom of God, no one will enter it. Don’t even try, and don’t teach others to do what you can’t do. Jesus gave the command &lt;em&gt;“Be Ye Perfect”&lt;/em&gt;, and many others like it in the Old Covenant context, only to show man’s utter helplessness and their need for God’s grace and mercies. He wanted to nudge them toward a New Covenant relationship with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin. (Romans 7:24-25—NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfection is God’s domain. Do not trespass.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Is the path narrow because of the difficulty or sacrifice it asks of its followers? Or it is only so because of the very narrowness of its definition? &lt;i&gt;(Phải chăng đường hẹp vì những khó khăn và hy sinh mà người theo phải chịu? Hoặc chỉ là hẹp về định nghĩa của nó?)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article under the same title was written by me, Nghi Nguyen, around the end of 2016, but this one is actually written by Ngô Vui who by the grace of God had come onto the same path to explore the incredible inheritance reserved for those who are in Christ. Enjoy. &lt;em&gt;(Tôi, Nghị Nguyễn, đã viết một bài với cùng tựa đề vào khoảng cuối năm 2016, nhưng bài này đã được viết bởi anh Ngô Vui, người mà bởi ân điển Chúa đã trở nên bạn đồng hành để khám phá cơ nghiệp diệu kỳ mà Chúa đã dành sẵn cho những kẻ ở trong Ngài. Xin mời bạn đọc cùng thưởng thức)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-narrow-path---con-đường-hẹp&quot;&gt;The Narrow Path - &lt;em&gt;Con Đường Hẹp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said: “Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free &lt;em&gt;( Chúa Giê-su phán: Khi các ngươi hiểu được sự thật, thì sự thật sẽ giải phóng các ngươi - John 8:32)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Jesus went on the cross, he spent 3 years to explain to the Israelites the true purpose of God’s law. For example, when he said &lt;em&gt;(Trước khi lên thập tự, Chúa Giê-su đã tốn 3 năm với người Do-thái để làm sáng tỏ ý nghĩa của luật pháp Đức Chúa Trời. Ví dụ khi Ngài phán)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment &lt;em&gt;(Luật pháp Môi-se dạy chớ giết người, nhưng ta bảo các ngươi nếu ai ghét anh em mình thì đã phạm tội ấy - Matthew 5:21 -22)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you &lt;em&gt;(Các ngươi có nghe lời phán rằng: Hãy yêu bạn, ghét thù. Nhưng ta bảo các ngươi hãy yêu kẻ thù nghịch, và cầu nguyện cho kẻ bắt bớ các ngươi - Matthew 5:43-44)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do not judge, or you too will be judged &lt;em&gt;(Đừng đoán xét người khác, để khỏi bị đoán xét - Matthew 7:1)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do to others as you would have them do to you &lt;em&gt;(Các ngươi muốn người ta làm cho mình thể nào, hãy làm cho người ta thể ấy - Luke 6:31)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect &lt;em&gt;(Các ngươi hãy nên trọn vẹn, như Cha các ngươi ở trên trời là trọn vẹn - Matthew 5:48)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many other things in the similar vein which forces the hearers to ponder within themselves: Who can escape sins? &lt;em&gt;(Và Ngài cũng phán nhiều điều khác nữa, khiến người nghe không khỏi tự hỏi trong lòng mình: Vậy thì ai thoát được tội?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely, from the beginning of time, mankind knew that God’s law was good and holy. But they consistently failed in all their efforts to reach perfection; efforts that were based on obedience to the requirements of the law &lt;em&gt;(Thật vậy, từ buổi ban đầu, nhân loại vốn nhận biết luật pháp Đức Chúa Trời là thiêng liêng và tốt lành. Thế nhưng, họ luôn luôn thất bại trong những nỗ lực đạt đến sự toàn thiện, những nỗ lực đặt nền tảng trên sự làm trọn các sự đòi hỏi của luật pháp)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God already knew this since before creation. Therefore, He preordained a way to lead man to eternal life, a way that Jesus called “the narrow path” &lt;em&gt;(Chúa đã biết điều này từ trước khi sáng thế. Do đó, Ngài đã sắm sẵn một con đường đưa nhân loại đến sự sống đời đời,  con đường mà Ngài gọi là “hẹp” - Matthew 7:13-14)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do Scriptures say about “The Narrow Path?” &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh nói gì về “Con Đường Hẹp?”)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe &lt;em&gt;(Bởi Con [là Chúa Giê-su] mà Đức Chúa Trời đã lập nên thế gian, và Con là Đấng kế tự muôn vật - Hebrews 1:2)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For just as through the disobedience of the one man [Adam] the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man [Jesus Christ]the many will be made righteous &lt;em&gt;(Bởi một người [là A-đam] không vâng phục mà &lt;u&gt;cả nhân loại đã bị kết tội&lt;/u&gt; thể nào, thì cũng bởi một người [là Chúa Giê-su] đã vâng phục trọn vẹn mà sự hòa thuận giữa Đức Chúa Trời với &lt;u&gt;những kẻ tin&lt;/u&gt; để được xưng công bình cũng như thể ấy - Romans 5:19)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake &lt;em&gt;(Trước khi sáng tạo vũ trụ, Thượng Đế đã dành sẵn Con Ngài cho mục đích ấy; nhưng đến thời kỳ chúng ta, Chúa Giê-su mới xuất hiện để thực thi chương trình cứu rỗi anh em - 1 Peter 1:20)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law &lt;em&gt;(Vậy thì sự khoe mình ở đâu? Bởi luật pháp của việc làm chăng? Không phải, nhưng bởi luật của đức tin. Vì người ta chỉ được xưng công bình bởi đức tin - Romans 3:27-28)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: What then is the purpose of the law? &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi: Vậy thì mục đích của luật pháp là gì?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is written&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh viết)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh viết:  Vả, chúng ta biết rằng những điều mà luật pháp nói, là nói cho mọi kẻ ở dưới luật pháp, hầu cho miệng nào cũng phải ngậm lại, cả thiên hạ đều nhận tội trước mặt Đức Chúa Trời; vì chẳng có một người nào bởi việc làm theo luật pháp mà sẽ được xưng công bình trước mặt Ngài, vì luật pháp cho người ta biết tội lỗi. - Romans 3:19-20)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: Who are under the law? &lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Everyone, those who have not accepted Christ as their Savior &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi: Ai là những kẻ ở dưới luật pháp? Trả lời: Cả thế gian, tất cả những người chưa tin nhận Chúa Giê-su là Cứu Chúa)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: What role then does the law play in the life of believers? &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi: Vậy luật pháp đóng vai trò gì  trong đời sống những kẻ tin?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is written&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh viết)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed &lt;em&gt;(Trước khi đức tin chưa đến, chúng ta bị nhốt dưới sự canh giữ của luật pháp mà chờ đức tin phải bày ra - Galatians 3:23)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith &lt;em&gt;(Ấy vậy, luật pháp đã như thầy giáo đặng dẫn chúng ta đến Đấng Christ, hầu cho chúng ta bởi đức tin mà được xưng công bình. - Galatians 3:24)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian &lt;em&gt;(Song khi đức tin đã đến, chúng ta không còn phục dưới thầy giáo ấy nữa - Galatians 3:25)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code &lt;em&gt;(Nhưng bây giờ chúng ta đã chết về luật-pháp, là điều bắt buộc mình, thì được buông tha khỏi luật-pháp đặng hầu việc Ðức Chúa Trời theo cách mới của Thánh Linh, chớ không theo cách cũ của văn tự - Romans 7:6)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? &lt;em&gt;(Vậy chúng ta sẽ nói làm sao? Chúng ta phải cứ ở trong tội lỗi, hầu cho ân điển được dư dật chăng? - Romans 6:1)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Trả lời)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? &lt;em&gt;(Chẳng hề như vậy! Chúng ta đã chết về tội lỗi, lẽ nào còn sống trong tội lỗi nữa? - Romans 6:2)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace &lt;em&gt;(Vì tội lỗi không cai trị trên anh em đâu; bởi anh em chẳng thuộc dưới luật pháp, mà thuộc dưới ân điển - Romans 6:14)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me &lt;em&gt;(Vả, bởi luật pháp, tôi đã chết cho luật pháp, để sống cho Đức Chúa Trời. Tôi đã bị đóng đinh vào thập tự giá với Đấng Christ, mà tôi sống, không phải là tôi sống nữa, nhưng Đấng Christ sống trong tôi; nay tôi còn sống trong xác thịt, ấy là tôi sống trong đức tin của Con Đức Chúa Trời, là Đấng đã yêu tôi, và đã phó chính mình Ngài vì tôi - Galatians 2:19-20)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing &lt;em&gt;(Tôi không muốn làm cho ân điển Đức Chúa Trời ra vô ích; vì nếu bởi luật pháp mà được sự công bình, thì Đấng Christ chịu chết là vô ích - Galatians 2:21)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace &lt;em&gt;(Nhưng nếu bởi ơn thì chẳng phải bởi việc làm nữa; bằng chẳng, thì ơn không còn phải là ơn - Romans 11:6)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt; How does reliance on obedience to the law affect one’s faith in God? &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi: Sự nương cậy vào luật pháp có ảnh hưởng gì đến đức tin?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is written&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh viết)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace &lt;em&gt;(Một khi anh em muốn nhờ luật pháp để được cứu rỗi, anh em đã tự ly khai với Đấng Christ và đánh mất ân điển của Thượng Đế - Galatians 5:4)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion---kết-luận&quot;&gt;In conclusion - &lt;em&gt;Kết luận&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrow path that Jesus spoke of is the path of faith apart from the law &lt;em&gt;(Con đường hẹp mà Chúa Giê-su nói đến là con đường của đức tin không lệ thuộc vào luật pháp)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin. But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe &lt;em&gt;(Sự công bình của Đức Chúa Trời được bày tỏ ra ngoài luật pháp cho mọi kẻ tin. Vì chẳng có việc làm nào theo luật pháp mà được xưng công bình trước mặt Đức Chúa Trời - Romans 3:20 -22)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it should become clear what God wants to convey to us through Paul. May God’s grace always be your greatest blessings &lt;em&gt;(Đến đây, chắc chắn chúng ta phải được sáng tỏ về điều Chúa muốn truyền đạt cho chúng ta qua Phao-lô. Nguyền xin ân điển Chúa mãi luôn là nguồn phước lớn nhất cho các bạn đọc)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ngô Vui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
