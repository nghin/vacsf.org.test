    &lt;p&gt;CHAPTER I&lt;br /&gt;
Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanities&lt;br /&gt;
1. He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, says the Lord. There are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far we must imitate His life and character, if we seek true illumination, and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Let it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is an excerpt from The Imitation of Christ by Thomas A. Kempis, the first paragraph of chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-assumption-about-jesus&quot;&gt;An assumption about Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/Imitating-Christ-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
 “How far we must imitate His life and character?” asked the author of Imitation of Christ. The author assumes that we can imitate Jesus, and it appears quite a few folks agree with him. But as far as my study of Scriptures has brought me, the idea of imitating Jesus, or him being an example, goes against the biblical message as a whole. I was motivated to write this article after reading an introduction to the gospel of Matthew from a new Vietnamese translation, in which the author, or authors, referred to Jesus as the supreme teacher who had the authority to interprete God’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-do-you-say-jesus-is&quot;&gt;Who do you say Jesus is?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People during Jesus’ time thought of him as a teacher. He performed miracles, turned water into wine, claimed to be the Son of God, but ultimately He was their teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 19:16-22, a rich young man came to see Jesus asking Him this: &lt;em&gt;“Good &lt;strong&gt;Teacher&lt;/strong&gt;, what &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; thing shall I &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; that I may have eternal life?”&lt;/em&gt; This young man’s question succinctly represents the world’s view of Jesus considering the bolded words in his question. Obviously he considered Jesus a teacher who tells him what good things he must do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John 3, we read of Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council, who came to meet Jesus one night saying: &lt;em&gt;“Rabbi, we know that you are a &lt;strong&gt;teacher&lt;/strong&gt; who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him.”&lt;/em&gt; And Jesus responded with: &lt;em&gt;“I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”&lt;/em&gt; Nicodemus had a hard time getting the meaning of being born from above because he could only see it from the eyes of the flesh. Much like the young man in the earlier story, he saw Jesus as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both these stories, there were nothing Jesus could teach them that they could do. Could the young man truly fulfill any of the commandments even if Jesus showed him how? Case in point is his love for his treasured possessions violates the very commandment of loving the Lord his God with all his heart. Could Nicodemus obey, or try to imitate Jesus, to “be born from above?” Not a chance. It took the universe forming creative power of God to perform such feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each descendant of Eve, the sin nature manifests itself in a different way. The bottom line is there is nothing Jesus can teach us, and nothing we can learn from him, to rid ourselves of this nature that had fallen short of God’s glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John 6 we read that after Jesus performed the miracle of turning a few fish and loaves of bread into enough food for five thousand people, and of walking on water, they asked him: &lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;‘What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires?’’ &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, ‘This is the deed God requires - to believe in the one whom he sent.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Nicodemus and the rich young ruler, the people immediately think of their flesh as a means to carry out what they think is God’s work. They wanted the teacher to tell them what to do, God said He only wanted them to believe in the one He had sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teacher-vs-savior-and-lord&quot;&gt;Teacher vs. Savior and Lord&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the gospel of Matthew we read that one day Jesus asked His disciples who they thought he was, they answered: &lt;em&gt;“Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets (Matthew 16:14).”&lt;/em&gt; Then He asked them directly who they thought He was, and Peter answered: &lt;em&gt;“You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16).”&lt;/em&gt; Jesus uses Peter’s answer to confirm his role not as a prophet,or any human at any capacity, but as Savior and Lord: &lt;em&gt;“Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven (Matthew 16:17).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the viewpoint of the flesh, Jesus is a human in various capacities: teacher, prophet, healer, etc., but from a divine revelation, He’s Savior and Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assuming-jesus-is-a-teacher&quot;&gt;Assuming Jesus is a teacher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument, let’s assume that Jesus came to be our teacher. What might he be teaching us? All the things pertaining to human relationships? Not at all, but only what pertains to the righteousness that restores us the right to become children of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could he teach us concerning the righteousness we needed that required His death on the cross? He performed miracles to authenticate his being sent by the Father—can this be imitated? He was born without sin, lived above sin, and died as an unblemished Lamb of God to take away our sin—can this be duplicated? He forgave sins past, present, and future of all of mankind—Imitate this? He raised people from the dead—Anyone? He is Almighty God—Dare you try this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However someone might raise an objection that there were plenty we could learn from Him on this side of eternity, such as humility, self denial, long suffering, and many qualities espoused in books through the ages. Kempis’ book Imitation of Christ is one such book. But except for some who are outside the norm, most folks appear to be socially and morally functional and they already possess the knowledge of these fine qualities expressed in Kempis’ book as well as taught by teachers even including Jesus. The Son of God didn’t need to leave heaven to teach us these basic principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man already had the ability to tell good from evil since the Garden of Eden (Romans 2:14). For the Jews, God spelled it out on tablets of stone. The problem isn’t that mankind needs to be taught anything that they couldn’t have learned already, it’s that though they knew all these things, they simply couldn’t do it. The apostle Paul expressed this dilemma in the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do. But what I hate, I do (Romans 7:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then shortly later Paul concludes with this observation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin (Romans 7:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we carefully follow Paul’s line of reasoning we’d find that though Christ is the solution to the perpetual struggle, in setting us free from the guilt of sins, there exists the reality of the sin nature that is a slave to the law of sin, and this will continue as long as we’re still in this corruptible state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;these-books-point-us-in-the-wrong-direction&quot;&gt;These books point us in the wrong direction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s survey another nugget of gold from Kempis’ book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches that shall perish. It is vanity, too, to covet honors, and to lift up ourselves on high. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh and be led by them, for this shall bring misery at the last. It is vanity to desire a long life, and to have little care for a good life. It is vanity to take thought only for the life which now is, and not to look forward to the things which shall be hereafter. It is vanity to love that which quickly passes away, and not to hasten where eternal joy abides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t it feel like a cross between Proverbs and Ecclesiastes? All this wisdom is already there in the pages of Scriptures, but again the problem is “what I want to do, I do not do.” As I recalled my earlier years in the Christian faith, I took in every thought in Imitation wholeheartedly, but the problem was I couldn’t put my finger on anything that would nudge me up one notch in the spirituality ladder. It felt like when I was sitting in a class that gave voice lessons and after hours had gone by, there was no breakthrough, I still couldn’t get that elusive high note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books like this gives the reader an illusion of getting somewhere without real changes even in the here and now, let alone eternity. They draw the readers deeper within themselves, round and round in circles while providing no escapes. I like the expression I learned from Bob George’s book “Growing in Grace,” if memory serves me correctly: morbid introspection. Through all this I realized I simply exchanged the books on existentialism, those I used to read before I became a Christian, for books dressed in Christianese with virtually the same content, words that came from the minds of philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faith-vs-learning-do-vs-done&quot;&gt;Faith vs. learning, do vs. done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we may learn skills such as computer programming, music, photography, and countless number of skills that are useful in this world’s economy, and many teachers can help us get where we desire, we can’t count on using the same approach toward the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was Nicodemus’ problem when he thought to be born again was to go back to his mother’s womb to start over again. Jesus explained to him that a product of human effort, no matter how well cloaked in spiritual piety, will produce flesh, it will not inherit the incorruptible (1 Corinthians 15:50), he must be born again by the Spirit of God, and the only instrument through which he could achieve this was faith in Christ, not through learning from even the most supreme of teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tendency to walk by the flesh, to use it to live out the Christian faith, is exemplified by the Galatians where Paul denounced in no uncertain terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? (Galatians 3:3—NASB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin by the Spirit is to start from God’s grace with nothing to rely on but faith, and perfecting oneself by the flesh is to try to improve from being already good enough for heaven to something even better. It’s this idea that Paul calls foolish. If Christ’s death on the cross is enough to make us perfect so we may come boldly to the throne of grace, how can anyone improve on what He’s already done? And worse yet all the presumed improvements will be done through the strength of the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example of someone who used to have an addiction to gambling, but since he came to Christ, the addiction was gone. This change though positive and it sure will save him from all the pain and suffering from the addiction, it does not make him any more sanctified than the day he received Christ into his heart. Christ did not come to save him from a multitude of sins, but to deliver him from the root of it all, his sin nature, the deliverance from the addiction is just a bonus just as Christ had promised in Matthew 6:33: &lt;em&gt;“Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.”&lt;/em&gt; All these things include that besetting sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The believer received the gift of deliverance from the addiction along with the greatest gift of all: Christ. The receiving of this gift of deliverance does not make him any more holy, or sanctified, than the moment he received Christ into his heart. Henceforth his life’s focus should be on His Redeemer and not on the gift, or any gift for that matter. It’s the job of the claymaker to mold him into any shape he wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books such as Kempis’ Imitation of Christ are guilty of taking they eyes of Christians off of Christ and turn them inward into themselves. Instead of explaining what Christ had done on the cross, the height, depth, and breadth of God’s plan of salvation, the righteousness that is theirs through Christ and everything they need for godliness and contentment that is included with Him, they turn the believers’ eyes toward themselves trying to draw from wretchedness and fallen flesh something to impress God and other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.S. Lewis vehemently denounced the very thought of thinking of Christ as a teacher when he wrote this in his book Mere Christianity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him [Jesus Christ]: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic—on a level with a man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God. &lt;strong&gt;But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that option open to us. He did not intend to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly agree with C.S. Lewis on that point. That was why when our Sunday School class read the introduction to the new translation of the Book of Matthew I was so taken aback and kept voicing my objection to such description of Jesus as a supreme teacher. Far be it from anyone who calls on the name of Jesus to think of Him as such.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We’ve all heard of the Ten Commandments, but did you know that originally God gave His people a choice between the law and grace? When God brought the Isrealites out of Egypt, He bore them eagles’s wings. In other words, he delivered them by grace. But instead of being contented to live by His grace, they wanted to live by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-mcgees-sermon&quot;&gt;Dr. McGee’s Sermon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/law-vs-grace-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The excerpt in large print above is from the introduction to Dr. J. Vernon McGee’s wonderful sermon on Exodus 19:4-25 which I happened to catch on the radio on Sept 21, 2016. I must have heard this message from Dr. McGee over thirty years ago, once every year for more than a decade, but never really understood it. I came to this understanding of law vs. grace through a different path, but hearing again from Dr. McGee this time, on the date of its re-broadcast on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-194-25-552552.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;September 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;, is quite a heavenly gift. His sermon inspired me to write this article from my own reflections of what this passage means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delivered-on-eagles-wings&quot;&gt;Delivered on eagles’ wings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I lifted you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. (Exodus 19:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know what was the state of the Israelites in Egypt, they were slaves under the brutal rule of their masters with no hope in sight. And yet here they were, delivered on “eagles’ wings.” This reminds me of Isaiah 40:31 where those who &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; upon the Lord will mount up with wings like eagles. This must have been the state of God’s people in Egypt, they were “waiting.” Or maybe they weren’t even waiting; after hundreds of years being slaves for generations in a foreign land, all their hope must have been lost. To wait is to still have some hope for something, therefore to these people whose last ray of hope was all but extinguished, what could they have been waiting for? Either way, waiting or not, they were at the end of their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminder, before the unfolding of events that leads to the giving of the law, the Ten Commandments, that came from the Lord must have been for them not to forget that they did nothing to deserve the magnificent rescue, that it wasn’t anything from themselves that they could get credit for, either their physical or moral prowess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God insists time a time again that it’s &lt;em&gt;“Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit”&lt;/em&gt; (Zechariah 4:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-kind-of-test&quot;&gt;A different kind of test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;And now, if you will diligently listen to me and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession out of all the nations, for all the earth is mine, &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;and you will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you (Moses) will speak to the Israelites.” (Exodus 19:5-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute! Aren’t they already God’s special possession? We know that God already made a covenant with Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3 that He would bless him and all his descendants, and we know that Abraham was called righteous before God because he believed the Lord (Genesis 15:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The covenant God made with Abraham was a covenant of faith, but this covenant that is coming down the mountain is altogether a different one that came with a condition that requires their diligent efforts. Why is God asking them now if they want to be His people as if they were not already His in the first place? What changed? No, nothing has changed. God is the same before, now, and forevermore, and He would never go back on His word (Hebrews 6:13-20). The only thing that could have changed was the people, either they didn’t believe God’s promise to their father Abraham, or they had never lived by the faith that was given them through Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God wasn’t testing whether they would desire or be willing to keep the impending law written on tablets of stone, but whether they trust Him enough to cling to His promise to Abraham. It is this faith that pleases Him, not self aggrandizing law keeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foolish-choice-that-they-made&quot;&gt;Foolish choice that they made&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;So Moses came and summoned the elders of Israel. He set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him, &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;and all the people answered together, &lt;strong&gt;“All that the Lord has commanded we will do!”&lt;/strong&gt; So Moses brought the words of the people back to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED WE WILL DO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As observed from the passage above, either they didn’t believe, or forgot the covenant that God made with father Abraham, or they willingly exchange that faith based covenant to a law based one, they exchanged grace for law. Though the Lord reminded them that it was on eagles’ wings that He delivered them, they chose to forget it. Much like so many people today who call themselves by Christ’s name steadfastly refuse to walk by faith, because by the law they would have reasons to boast of their own righteousness (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:27-28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such foolishness! (Galatians 3:1-6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often cites Jesus love command &lt;em&gt;“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind”&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 22:37) with such self confidence like the people in verse 8 above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s read an interaction between Jesus and a rich young man who came to ask Him how to have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Now behold, one came and said to Him, “Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?” &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;He said to Him, “Which ones?” Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;The young man said to Him, &lt;strong&gt;“All these things I have kept from my youth&lt;/strong&gt;. What do I still lack?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.” &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. (Matthew 19:16-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young man in this story committed fatal errors not unlike the Exodus people above when he answered Jesus: “All these things I have kept from my youth.” Really? There is no one under the sun that can keep even a single commandment, let alone keeping all of them, but Jesus knew what is in the heart of this young man and he used it to bring him to the place of admitting his failure: his possessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test the Lord presented to the Israelites at the foot of mount Sinai was not whether they’d be able to keep the commandments He was about to give them, but whether they would want to relate to Him in one of the following two ways both of which represent a faith-based relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They trusted the Lord enough to claim His covenant with Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They acknowledge their inability to adhere to the law-based covenant which God was about to deliver and cry out for mercy instead, and pray to Him if they could continue to ride on eagles’ wings for the remainder of their lives. Those who come to God in this manner He would in no wise cast out (John 6:37).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reminding them of how He had delivered them out of Egypt on eagles’ wings, the Lord was extending to them His hand of mercy but sadly they responded like many gung-ho Christians today: “All that the Lord has commanded we will do!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-days-to-change-their-minds&quot;&gt;Three days to change their minds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and so that they will always believe in you.” And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord (Exodus 19:9).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and make them wash their clothes &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;and be ready for the third day, for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;You must set boundaries for the people all around, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves not to go up on the mountain nor touch its edge. Whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death! &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;No hand will touch him—but he will surely be stoned or shot through, whether a beast or a human being; he must not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast they may go up on the mountain.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;He said to the people, “Be ready for the third day. Do not go near your wives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord gave the people three days to prepare themselves for what is coming. What is He trying to convey to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The dense cloud in which the Lord is descending shows He’s far from accessible to the people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boundaries were set for the people around the edge of the mountain where violators, be they men or beasts, will be stoned or shot through with arrows to death. Once again the inaccessibility of God is affirmed, and &lt;em&gt;“flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable”&lt;/em&gt; (1 Corinthians 15:50)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even with all these preparations, being sanctified by Moses in whatever shape or form, clothes washed, sexual relations abstained, they could not see God. All that were just to prepare them for the third day; they were just ceremonially clean on the outside with no real change on their sin nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should these three days facing the terrible mountain of God alarm them enough to beg God for a different condition in their relationship with Him? That they could continue to ride with Him on wings of eagles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-forced-access-allowed&quot;&gt;No forced access allowed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the Lord had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the Lord to look and many of them perish. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Also let the priests who come near to the Lord consecrate themselves, lest the Lord break out against them.” &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;And Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, ‘Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.’” &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But &lt;strong&gt;do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord&lt;/strong&gt;, lest he break out against them.” &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;So Moses went down to the people and told them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key idea in this passage is that the people, including the priests, are not allowed to “break through” to come near the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again &lt;em&gt;“It’s not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit”&lt;/em&gt; (Zechariah 4:6). God allows only one means of access to Him: through Christ, and our faith in Him. People forget that it’s the keeping of the law as means to draw near to God that offends Him, and their law keeping may manifest in ways that seem very spiritual: when they pray, when they give their offerings, when they do their good deeds. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED WE WILL DO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Such foolishness that sent them back to the desert for 40 more years and most never made it to the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;law-vs-grace&quot;&gt;Law vs. Grace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. McGee gave a list of contrasts between the law and grace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law demands, grace gives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says do, grace says believe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law exacts, grace bestows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says work, grace says rest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law threatens pronouncing a curse, grace entreats pronouncing a blessing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says do and thou shalt live, grace says live and thou shalt do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law condemns the best man, and grace saves the worst man&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law reveals the character of God, and it also reveals the weakness of man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your choice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-mcgees-sermon&quot;&gt;Dr. McGee’s Sermon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/law-vs-grace-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The excerpt in large print above is from the introduction to Dr. J. Vernon McGee’s wonderful sermon on Exodus 19:4-25 which I happened to catch on the radio on Sept 21, 2016. I must have heard this message from Dr. McGee over thirty years ago, once every year for more than a decade, but never really understood it. I came to this understanding of law vs. grace through a different path, but hearing again from Dr. McGee this time, on the date of its re-broadcast on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-194-25-552552.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;September 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;, is quite a heavenly gift. His sermon inspired me to write this article from my own reflections of what this passage means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delivered-on-eagles-wings&quot;&gt;Delivered on eagles’ wings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I lifted you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. (Exodus 19:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know what was the state of the Israelites in Egypt, they were slaves under the brutal rule of their masters with no hope in sight. And yet here they were, delivered on “eagles’ wings.” This reminds me of Isaiah 40:31 where those who &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; upon the Lord will mount up with wings like eagles. This must have been the state of God’s people in Egypt, they were “waiting.” Or maybe they weren’t even waiting; after hundreds of years being slaves for generations in a foreign land, all their hope must have been lost. To wait is to still have some hope for something, therefore to these people whose last ray of hope was all but extinguished, what could they have been waiting for? Either way, waiting or not, they were at the end of their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminder, before the unfolding of events that leads to the giving of the law, the Ten Commandments, that came from the Lord must have been for them not to forget that they did nothing to deserve the magnificent rescue, that it wasn’t anything from themselves that they could get credit for, either their physical or moral prowess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God insists time a time again that it’s &lt;em&gt;“Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit”&lt;/em&gt; (Zechariah 4:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-kind-of-test&quot;&gt;A different kind of test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;And now, if you will diligently listen to me and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession out of all the nations, for all the earth is mine, &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;and you will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you (Moses) will speak to the Israelites.” (Exodus 19:5-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute! Aren’t they already God’s special possession? We know that God already made a covenant with Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3 that He would bless him and all his descendants, and we know that Abraham was called righteous before God because he believed the Lord (Genesis 15:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The covenant God made with Abraham was a covenant of faith, but this covenant that is coming down the mountain is altogether a different one that came with a condition that requires their diligent efforts. Why is God asking them now if they want to be His people as if they were not already His in the first place? What changed? No, nothing has changed. God is the same before, now, and forevermore, and He would never go back on His word (Hebrews 6:13-20). The only thing that could have changed was the people, either they didn’t believe God’s promise to their father Abraham, or they had never lived by the faith that was given them through Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God wasn’t testing whether they would desire or be willing to keep the impending law written on tablets of stone, but whether they trust Him enough to cling to His promise to Abraham. It is this faith that pleases Him, not self aggrandizing law keeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foolish-choice-that-they-made&quot;&gt;Foolish choice that they made&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;So Moses came and summoned the elders of Israel. He set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him, &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;and all the people answered together, &lt;strong&gt;“All that the Lord has commanded we will do!”&lt;/strong&gt; So Moses brought the words of the people back to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED WE WILL DO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As observed from the passage above, either they didn’t believe, or forgot the covenant that God made with father Abraham, or they willingly exchange that faith based covenant to a law based one, they exchanged grace for law. Though the Lord reminded them that it was on eagles’ wings that He delivered them, they chose to forget it. Much like so many people today who call themselves by Christ’s name steadfastly refuse to walk by faith, because by the law they would have reasons to boast of their own righteousness (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:27-28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such foolishness! (Galatians 3:1-6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often cites Jesus love command &lt;em&gt;“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind”&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 22:37) with such self confidence like the people in verse 8 above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s read an interaction between Jesus and a rich young man who came to ask Him how to have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Now behold, one came and said to Him, “Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?” &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;He said to Him, “Which ones?” Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;The young man said to Him, &lt;strong&gt;“All these things I have kept from my youth&lt;/strong&gt;. What do I still lack?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.” &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. (Matthew 19:16-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young man in this story committed fatal errors not unlike the Exodus people above when he answered Jesus: “All these things I have kept from my youth.” Really? There is no one under the sun that can keep even a single commandment, let alone keeping all of them, but Jesus knew what is in the heart of this young man and he used it to bring him to the place of admitting his failure: his possessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test the Lord presented to the Israelites at the foot of mount Sinai was not whether they’d be able to keep the commandments He was about to give them, but whether they would want to relate to Him in one of the following two ways both of which represent a faith-based relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They trusted the Lord enough to claim His covenant with Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They acknowledge their inability to adhere to the law-based covenant which God was about to deliver and cry out for mercy instead, and pray to Him if they could continue to ride on eagles’ wings for the remainder of their lives. Those who come to God in this manner He would in no wise cast out (John 6:37).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reminding them of how He had delivered them out of Egypt on eagles’ wings, the Lord was extending to them His hand of mercy but sadly they responded like many gung-ho Christians today: “All that the Lord has commanded we will do!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-days-to-change-their-minds&quot;&gt;Three days to change their minds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and so that they will always believe in you.” And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord (Exodus 19:9).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and make them wash their clothes &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;and be ready for the third day, for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;You must set boundaries for the people all around, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves not to go up on the mountain nor touch its edge. Whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death! &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;No hand will touch him—but he will surely be stoned or shot through, whether a beast or a human being; he must not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast they may go up on the mountain.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;He said to the people, “Be ready for the third day. Do not go near your wives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord gave the people three days to prepare themselves for what is coming. What is He trying to convey to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The dense cloud in which the Lord is descending shows He’s far from accessible to the people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boundaries were set for the people around the edge of the mountain where violators, be they men or beasts, will be stoned or shot through with arrows to death. Once again the inaccessibility of God is affirmed, and &lt;em&gt;“flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable”&lt;/em&gt; (1 Corinthians 15:50)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even with all these preparations, being sanctified by Moses in whatever shape or form, clothes washed, sexual relations abstained, they could not see God. All that were just to prepare them for the third day; they were just ceremonially clean on the outside with no real change on their sin nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should these three days facing the terrible mountain of God alarm them enough to beg God for a different condition in their relationship with Him? That they could continue to ride with Him on wings of eagles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-forced-access-allowed&quot;&gt;No forced access allowed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the Lord had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the Lord to look and many of them perish. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Also let the priests who come near to the Lord consecrate themselves, lest the Lord break out against them.” &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;And Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, ‘Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.’” &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But &lt;strong&gt;do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord&lt;/strong&gt;, lest he break out against them.” &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;So Moses went down to the people and told them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key idea in this passage is that the people, including the priests, are not allowed to “break through” to come near the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again &lt;em&gt;“It’s not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit”&lt;/em&gt; (Zechariah 4:6). God allows only one means of access to Him: through Christ, and our faith in Him. People forget that it’s the keeping of the law as means to draw near to God that offends Him, and their law keeping may manifest in ways that seem very spiritual: when they pray, when they give their offerings, when they do their good deeds. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED WE WILL DO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Such foolishness that sent them back to the desert for 40 more years and most never made it to the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;law-vs-grace&quot;&gt;Law vs. Grace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. McGee gave a list of contrasts between the law and grace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law demands, grace gives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says do, grace says believe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law exacts, grace bestows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says work, grace says rest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law threatens pronouncing a curse, grace entreats pronouncing a blessing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says do and thou shalt live, grace says live and thou shalt do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law condemns the best man, and grace saves the worst man&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law reveals the character of God, and it also reveals the weakness of man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your choice?&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">We’ve all heard of the Ten Commandments, but did you know that originally God gave His people a choice between the law and grace? When God brought the Isrealites out of Egypt, He bore them eagles’s wings. In other words, he delivered them by grace. But instead of being contented to live by His grace, they wanted to live by law.</summary>

    &lt;p&gt;Chúng ta đã từng nghe nói về Mười Điều Răn, nhưng có ai biết rằng từ nguyên thủy Chúa đã cho dân sự của Ngài một sự lựa chọn giữa luật pháp và ân điển? Khi đưa người Do-thái ra khỏi xứ Ai-cập, Chúa đã gánh họ trên cánh chim ưng. Nói cách khác, Ngài đã giải thoát họ bằng ân điển. Nhưng thay vì thỏa lòng sống trong ân điển Chúa, họ lại muốn sống dưới luật pháp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bi-ging-ca-dr-mcgee&quot;&gt;Bài giảng của Dr. McGee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/law-vs-grace-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Đoạn trích ra in bằng chữ lớn ở trên là từ phần giới thiệu bài giảng rất hay của Dr. J. Vernon McGee về đoạn Xuất Ê-díp-tô Ký 19:4-25 mà tôi đã tình cờ được nghe trong ra-đi-ô vào ngày 21 tháng Chín, 2016. Có lẽ tôi đã được nghe bài giảng này của Dr. McGee hơn ba mươi năm qua, mỗi năm một lần trong hơn một thập niên, nhưng không thực sự hiểu thấu. Tôi đã đi đến sự hiểu biết ngày hôm nay qua sự dẫn dắt riêng của Chúa trong cuộc sống, nhưng được nghe lại từ Dr. McGee lần này trong giờ phát thanh lại vào ngày &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-194-25-552552.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;21 tháng Chín, 2016&lt;/a&gt; thực là một món quà từ thiên thượng. Bài giảng của ông khích lệ tôi viết bài này từ sự suy gẫm và hiểu biết của riêng tôi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trn-cnh-chim-ng&quot;&gt;Trên cánh chim ưng&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Các ngươi đã thấy điều ta làm cho người Ê-díp-tô, ta chở các ngươi trên cánh chim ưng làm sao, và dẫn các ngươi đến cùng ta thể nào. (Exodus 19:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta biết tình trạng của người Do-thái ở xứ Ai-cập, là nô lệ dưới sự thống trị tàn bạo của những người chủ mà chẳng còn hy vọng gì trong tầm mắt. Thế mà giờ đây họ đã được Chúa giải thoát trên “cánh chim ưng.” Điều này nhắc tôi nhớ lại Isaiah 40:31 nói về những kẻ trông đợi nơi Chúa thì được cất cánh bao cao như chim ưng. Đây chắc phải là tâm trạng của dân Chúa ở Ai-cập, họ đang “trông đợi.” Hay có lẽ họ cũng chẳng trông đợi đâu; sau hằng trăm năm nô lệ qua nhiều thế hệ ở nơi đất khách quê người, mọi hy vọng dường như tan biến. Còn đợi chờ là còn hy vọng vào một điều gì đó, do đó với dân này tia hy vọng cuối cùng dường như tan biến, vậy họ còn mong đợi điều gì? Dù sao đi nữa, đợi hay không đợi, họ chẳng còn cách nào khác nữa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lời nhắc nhở này, trước những diễn biến dẫn đến sự họ được ban luật pháp, Mười Điều Răn, đến từ nơi Đức Chúa Trời hẳn phải nhằm mục đích khiến họ đừng quên rằng họ đã chẳng đóng vai trò gì trong sự giải cứu vĩ đại đó, chẳng điều gì đến từ họ để có thể kể công, bởi sức mạnh của xác thịt hoặc đạo đức luân lý.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đức Chúa Trời đã bao lần quả quyết rằng &lt;em&gt;“Chẳng phải là bởi quyền thế, cũng chẳng phải là bởi năng lực, bèn là bởi Thần ta, Ðức Giê-hô-va vạn quân phán vậy” (&lt;u&gt;Zechariah 4:6&lt;/u&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mt-loi-th-thch-khc&quot;&gt;Một loại thử thách khác&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy, bây giờ, nếu các ngươi vâng lời ta và giữ sự giao ước ta, thì trong muôn dân, các ngươi sẽ thuộc riêng về ta, vì cả thế gian đều thuộc về ta. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Các ngươi sẽ thành một nước thầy tế lễ, cùng một dân tộc thánh cho ta. Bấy nhiêu lời đó ngươi sẽ nói lại cùng dân Y-sơ-ra-ên. (Exodus 19:5-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khoan đã! Chẳng phải họ đã là tuyển dân của Chúa sao? Chúng ta biết rằng Chúa đã giao ước với Áp-ra-ham trong Genesis 12:1-3 rằng Ngài sẽ ban phước cho ông và dòng dõi ông, và chúng ta cũng biết rằng Áp-ra-ham được xưng công bình trước mặt Đức Chúa Trời vì ông tin Ngài (Genesis 15:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giao ước mà Đức Chúa Trời đã lập với Áp-ra-ham là một giao ước đặt trên nền tảng đức tin, nhưng giao ước xuống từ đỉnh Si-nai thì hoàn toàn khác vì kèm theo một điều kiện đòi hỏi những nỗ lực của họ. Tại sao Chúa lại hỏi họ một điều như thể họ chưa phải là tuyển dân của Ngài? Có gì đã thay đổi? Không, chẳng có thì thay đổi. Đức Chúa Trời vẫn thế từ trước, hôm nay, và cho đến đời đời, và Ngài sẽ không bao giờ bội ước(Hebrews 6:13-20). Điều duy nhất có thể thay đổi là loài người, hoặc họ đã không tin vào lời hứa của Chúa cho Áp-ra-ham, hoặc họ đã chẳng từng sống trong niềm tin đã được ban cho họ qua ông.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đức Chúa Trời không thử thách họ về sự họ có muốn hoặc sẵn lòng giữ những điều răn viết trên bảng đá, nhưng về sự họ có tin Ngài đủ để nắm chặt lời hứa mà Ngài đã lập với Áp-ra-ham. Đó là đức tin làm đẹp lòng Ngài chứ chẳng phải sự làm theo lề luật để tự tôn mình lên cao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;s-chn-la-di-dt&quot;&gt;Sự chọn lựa dại dột&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Môi-se đến đòi các trưởng lão trong dân sự, thuật cùng họ mọi lời Ðức Giê-hô-va đã dặn mình nói lại. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Cả dân sự đồng thanh đáp rằng: &lt;strong&gt;Chúng tôi xin làm mọi việc Ðức Giê-hô-va đã phán dặn!&lt;/strong&gt; (Exodus 19:7-8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHÚNG TÔI XIN LÀM MỌI VIỆC ĐỨC GIÊ_HÔ_VA ĐÃ PHÁN DẶN!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Như chúng ta đã nhận thấy trong đoạn Kinh thánh trên, hoặc họ không tin, hoặc đã quên giao ước mà Đức Chúa Trời đã lập cùng tổ Áp-ra-ham, hoặc họ đã bằng lòng trao đổi giao ước của đức tin lấy giao ước của luật pháp. Mặc dầu Chúa đã nhắc nhở họ về sự Ngài đã giải cứu họ trên cánh chim ưng, họ đã chọn để quên điều đó. Cũng như nhiều người ngày hôm nay xưng nhận danh Đấng Christ nhưng nhất quyết không bước đi trong đức tin, vì nếu nhờ luật pháp thì họ có cớ để khoe khoang về công bình của chính mình (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:27-28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quả là dại dột! (Galatians 3:1-6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nhiều người thường nhắc đến mệnh lệnh yêu thương của Chúa Giê-su &lt;em&gt;“Ngươi hãy hết lòng, hết linh hồn, hết ý mà yêu mến Chúa, là Ðức Chúa Trời ngươi”&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 22:37) với sự tự tin giống như những người trong câu 8 ở trên.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hãy đọc mẩu đối thoại giữa Chúa Giê-su và người trẻ tuổi giàu có khi anh đến hỏi Chúa làm sao để được sự sống đời đời.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Nầy, có một người đến hỏi Ngài rằng: Theo thầy, tôi phải làm việc lành chi cho được sự sống đời đời?  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Chúa Jêsus đáp rằng: Sao ngươi hỏi ta về việc lành? Chỉ có một Ðấng lành mà thôi. Nếu ngươi muốn vào sự sống, thì phải giữ các điều răn.  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Người hỏi: Những điều răn gì? Ðức Chúa Jêsus phán rằng: Những điều răn nầy: Ðừng giết người; đừng phạm tội tà dâm; đừng ăn trộm cắp; đừng làm chứng dối;  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Hãy thảo kính cha mẹ; và: Hãy yêu kẻ lân cận như mình.  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Người trẻ đó thưa rằng: &lt;strong&gt;Tôi đã giữ đủ các điều nầy&lt;/strong&gt;; còn thiếu chi cho tôi nữa?  &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Chúa Jêsus phán rằng: Nếu ngươi muốn được trọn vẹn, hãy đi bán hết gia tài mà bố thí cho kẻ nghèo nàn, thì ngươi sẽ có của quí ở trên trời; rồi hãy đến mà theo ta.  &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Nhưng khi người trẻ nghe xong lời nầy, thì đi, bộ buồn bực; vì chàng có của cải nhiều lắm (Matthew 19:16-22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Người trẻ tuổi trong câu chuyện này đã phạm cùng một lầm lỗi to lớn chẳng khác gì những người trong sách Xuất Ê-díp-tô Ký ở trên khi anh trả lời Chúa Giê-su: &lt;em&gt;“Tôi đã giữ đủ các điều nầy.”&lt;/em&gt; Có thật vậy không? Vì chẳng một ai dưới ánh mặt trời có thể giữ dù chỉ một điều chứ đừng nói đến giữ mọi điều, nhưng Chúa Giê-su biết điều sâu kín trong lòng thanh niên này và Ngài đã dùng điều đó để dẫn anh đến chỗ nhìn nhận thất bại của mình: sự giàu có của anh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sự thử thách Chúa đem đến cho người Do-thái ở chân núi Si-nai chẳng phải để xem họ có thể giữ những điều răn Ngài sẽ ban cho họ, nhưng để xem họ có muốn liên hệ với Ngài qua một trong hai cách dưới đây mà cả hai đều biểu tượng cho mối liên hệ đặt nền tảng trên đức tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Họ tin cậy Chúa đủ để đòi hỏi được có cùng giao ước giữa Đức Chúa Trời và Áp-ra-ham (Genesis 12:1-3).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Họ nhìn nhận sự bất lực của mình để giữ giao ước dựa trên luật pháp mà Đức Chúa Trời sắp ban cho họ và thay vào đó bằng sự thương xót của Ngài, và cầu xin Ngài nếu họ có thể được cứ bước đi với Ngài trên cánh chim ưng. Những người đến với Đức Chúa Trời theo cung cách đó sẽ chẳng bị Ngài từ khước (John 6:37).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khi nhắc nhở họ về sự Ngài đã giải cứu họ như trên cánh chim ưng, Chúa mở rộng vòng tay thương xót của Ngài đến họ nhưng buồn thay họ phản ứng chẳng khác gì nhiều tín hữu oai phong của thời nay: “Chúng tôi xin làm mọi việc Ðức Giê-hô-va đã phán dặn!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ba-ngy--quyt-nh&quot;&gt;Ba ngày để quyết định&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;CHÚA phán với Môi-se rằng: “Ta sẽ đến với con trong đám mây dày đặc và cho dân chúng được nghe Ta nói chuyện với con để chúng luôn tin tưởng con.” Môi-se cũng trình lên cho CHÚA những điều dân Y-sơ-ra-ên đã nói.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;CHÚA phán dạy Môi-se: “Con hãy đến với dân Y-sơ-ra-ên và bảo họ làm cho mình thánh sạch trong ngày hôm nay và ngày mai. Bảo họ giặt áo xống  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;và phải sẵn sàng vào ngày thứ ba vì ngày đó CHÚA sẽ giáng lâm trên núi Si-nai trước mắt toàn dân.  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;Con phải vạch ranh giới xung quanh núi cho dân chúng và bảo họ: ‘Phải cẩn thận đừng lên núi cũng đừng đụng đến chân núi. Ai đụng đến núi phải bị xử tử.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Người đó sẽ bị ném đá hoặc bị bắn tên cho chết; không ai được đưa tay sờ đến người đó. Dù là người ta hay súc vật, hễ đụng đến núi thì phải chết. Chỉ khi nào có tiếng kèn thổi dài người ta mới được lên núi.’ ”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Môi-se ở trên núi xuống, đến với dân chúng, bảo họ giữ mình thánh sạch và giặt áo xống. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;Người dặn dân sự rằng: Trong ba ngày hãy sẵn sàng chớ đến gần đàn bà (Exodus 19:9-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đức Chúa Trời cho dân sự ba ngày để chuẩn bị cho điều sắp xảy đến. Ngài muốn bày tỏ điều gì với họ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Đám mây dày đặc bao phủ sự hiện xuống của Chúa cho thấy vẫn có sự ngăn cách giữa họ với Ngài.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ranh giới được vạch ra cho dân sự chung quanh chân núi nơi mà kẻ vi phạm, người hoặc thú, đều phải bị ném đá hoặc bắn tên cho đến chết. Một lần nữa sự ngăn cách giữa Đức Chúa Trời và tạo vật lại được xác định, và &lt;em&gt;“thịt và huyết chẳng được hưởng nước Đức Chúa Trời, cũng như sự hay hư nát chẳng được hưởng sự không hư nát (1 Corinthians 15:50).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dù với sự chuẩn bị như vậy, sự làm cho thánh sạch qua mọi hình thức, giặt dũ quần áo, tránh liên hệ tình dục, họ cũng chẳng được thấy Đức Chúa Trời. Tất cả chỉ để chuẩn bị họ cho ngày thứ ba; họ chỉ sạch sẽ về nghi lễ bề ngoài nhưng bản chất tội lỗi thì hoàn toàn không thay đổi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ba ngày đối diện với ngọn núi kinh khủng của Đức Chúa Trời có gây sự báo động trong lòng họ đến nỗi họ phải nài xin một cách khác để liên hệ với Ngài không? Rằng họ có thể được tiếp tục đi với Ngài trên cánh chim ưng?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ch-vt-ranh-gii&quot;&gt;Chớ vượt ranh giới&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Qua sáng ngày thứ ba, có sấm vang chớp nhoáng, một áng mây mịt mịt ở trên núi, và tiếng kèn thổi rất vang động; cả dân sự ở trong trại quân đều run hãi.  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Môi-se bèn biểu dân ra khỏi trại quân nghinh tiếp Ðức Chúa Trời; dân sự dừng lại tại chân núi.  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Vả, bấy giờ, khắp núi Si-na -i đều ra khói, vì Ðức Giê-hô-va ở trong lửa giáng lâm nơi đó; khói ra khác nào khói của lò lửa lớn kia, và cả hòn núi đều rung động cách kịch liệt.  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Tiếng kèn càng vang động; Môi-se nói, Ðức Chúa Trời đáp tiếng lại.  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Giê-hô-va giáng-lâm trên chót núi Si-na -i, đòi Môi-se lên, Môi-se bèn lên.  &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Giê-hô-va phán rằng: Hãy xuống &lt;strong&gt;cấm dân sự không được vượt ranh giới&lt;/strong&gt; đến gần Ðức Giê-hô-va mà nhìn, e nhiều người trong bọn phải chết chăng.  &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Dầu những thầy tế lễ đến gần Ðức Giê-hô-va cũng phải giữ mình thánh sạch, kẻo Ngài hại họ chăng. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Môi-se thưa cùng Ðức Giê-hô-va rằng: Dân sự chẳng được lên núi Si-na -i đâu, vì Ngài có cấm chúng tôi mà phán rằng: Hãy phân định giới hạn chung quanh núi, và phân biệt nơi đó là đất thánh. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Giê-hô-va phán rằng: Hãy đi xuống, rồi đem A-rôn lên cùng ngươi, song &lt;strong&gt;những thầy tế lễ và dân sự chớ vượt ranh giới&lt;/strong&gt; đặng lên đến gần Ðức Giê-hô-va, e Ngài hại họ chăng. &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy, Môi-se đi xuống, nói lại cho dân sự nghe (Exodus 19:16-25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ý chính trong đoạn này là dân sự, kể cả các thầy tế lễ, đều không được “vượt ranh giới” để đến gần Đức Chúa Trời.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lại một lần nữa, “Chẳng phải bởi quyền thế, cũng chẳng phải bởi năng lực, nhưng bởi Thần Ta” (Zechariah 4:6). Đức Chúa Trời chỉ cho một con đường đến gần Ngài: đó là qua Đấng Christ bởi đức tin. Người ta quên rằng điều nghịch ý Chúa là sự cậy vào luật pháp để đến gần Ngài, và sự tuân theo luật pháp đó có thể được biểu lộ qua những việc làm có vẻ thiêng liêng: khi cầu nguyện, khi dâng hiến, khi làm những việc lành. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHÚNG TÔI XIN LÀM MỌI VIỆC ĐỨC GIÊ_HÔ_VA ĐÃ PHÁN DẶN!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Sự dại dột đó đã đẩy họ trở lại trong đồng vắng thêm 40 năm nữa và hầu hết đã bỏ thây ở đó.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lut-php-vs-n-in&quot;&gt;Luật Pháp vs. Ân Điển&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. McGee đã liệt kê một bảng tương phản giữa luật pháp và ân điển:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luật pháp đòi hỏi, ân điển ban cho&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luật pháp bảo phải làm, ân điển nói hãy tin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luật pháp bảo phải làm, ân điển khuyên an nghỉ&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luật pháp đe dọa trong lời nguyền rủa, ân điển khuyên lơn trong lời chúc phước&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luật pháp nói hãy làm thì được sống, ân điển dạy sống thì sẽ được làm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luật pháp lên án người tốt nhất, còn ân điển cứu người tệ hại nhất&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luật pháp tỏ lộ bản tính Đức Chúa Trời, và cũng bày tỏ sự yếu đuối của loài người&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <summary type="text">Chúng ta đã từng nghe nói về Mười Điều Răn, nhưng có ai biết rằng từ nguyên thủy Chúa đã cho dân sự của Ngài một sự lựa chọn giữa luật pháp và ân điển? Khi đưa người Do-thái ra khỏi xứ Ai-cập, Chúa đã gánh họ trên cánh chim ưng. Nói cách khác, Ngài đã giải thoát họ bằng ân điển. Nhưng thay vì thỏa lòng sống trong ân điển Chúa, họ lại muốn sống dưới luật pháp.</summary>

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-world-the-flesh-and-sin&quot;&gt;The world, the flesh, and sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/do-not-conform-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The general consensus is the world, whose definition we’ll explore later, is something negative that we must take care not to conform to its patterns. This negative something is generally accepted as sinful things that we must get rid of from our lives. The more of these sins we can get rid of, the closer we are to God. Oftentimes Hebrews 12:1 is brought into the picture to support the argument that we should make every effort to get rid of &lt;em&gt;“the sin that easily entangles.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick survey of all available commentaries reveals that they also hold the same interpretation, or perhaps they influence the rest of Christianity with their points of views? But people don’t really need commentaries to form this world view, all you need is take a survey of some of the major world’s religions, they all hold the same concept of sins and the need to deal with them in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All religions hold the belief that the flesh is basically sinful, a negative force that must be subdued or even annihilated if one hopes to achieve a higher state of being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should not be a surprise to us that Christians, most if not almost all, also subscribe to this mode of thinking though it may be dressed in a more appropriate Christian language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand we’re exhorted to “love not the world” (1 John 2:15), on the other hand we must live in it, we share in this world the work we do to make a living, we drive on the same road, we go to the same movie theater, we watch the same TV broadcast, we traverse on the same Internet highway. Wouldn’t this internal conflict cause much trouble in a Christian’s life? Much morbid introspection that weighs heavily on the heart of the one who wants to do the right thing in accordance with their faith?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most commentaries are very long winded about what constitutes this “pattern of the world,” but to simplify the matter, the dividing line is between what is sinful and what is not, isn’t it? Then it logically follows that the command “do not conform to the patterns of this world” can be restated as simply as “do not sin anymore.” Does this make sense? Isn’t this what is implied in all sermons and writings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult not to talk about the world without also calling into question the issue of sin. This is reflected in all the world’s religions, and Christianity is not exempted from it. Therefore if the question of not conforming to the patterns of the world is to be understood to be analogous to stop sinning, we may be better off taken from this world altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-elusive-goal&quot;&gt;An elusive goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for anyone to be completely without sin?  The answer is easy right from the Bible itself, therefore if “do not conform” is to be understood in the conventional sense, we’re setting ourselves up for a lifetime of discouragement and hopelessness because the fact of our daily transgression will stare at us in the face on a continual basis. I read that Martin Luther used to take 6 hours per day to confess his sins, but I believe that had Luther, or the listening priest, had the strength, he would have had confessed all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-christian-things-that-we-do&quot;&gt;The Christian things that we do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though most pulpits do not preach it outright, virtually all pew sitters assume this is what they heard: worldly things are those not directly related to Bible study, church activities, ministries, evangelistic endeavors, prayer, etc. The way to please God is to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; as many of these things as possible. We read in John 6:28-29 that upon hearing Jesus’ teaching, the crowd asked Him what the works of God were so that they could &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; them. People also asked Paul in Acts 16:30 about what they must &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; to be saved. The same type of questions were posed to Jesus in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lady in our church who works very hard to provide for her family with many sick people. Occasionally in our Sunday School class she would express her regret that she could not find time to do “God’s works.” I tried very hard to convince her that God’s works are those things she does when she works in her nail salon, when she cares for her sick husband and his sibblings, when she tries to catch a breath from between many responsibilities. In her mind these are “worldly things” that don’t count toward God’s kingdom. But it’s not just this lady who holds such a view of “the world,” it’s probably 99.99% of folks you sit next to every Sunday singing hymns of grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does this understanding, or rather misunderstanding, come from? Where else but from the lack of sound teaching to ground the flocks in the absolute promise of salvation to those who call by Jesus’ name. Most messages I heard everywhere are about things Christians should or shouldn’t do. A disproptionate amount of communication is dedicated toward topics such as family, raising children, marriage, work, play, sex, and everything that is perceived as good under the sun. But all these things, as good as most of them are, are not in the exclusive domain of Christianity; they can all be found in non-Christian sources. Christ didn’t come to address these corruptible things. He came to address an issue buried deep in the nature of man. The focus on nonessential matter is the reason few Christians are grounded in the truth of how God saves us and accepts us in His Son Jesus Christ. And when Christians are not deeply rooted in Christ, false doctrine finds its fertile ground to grow like weeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-romans-context&quot;&gt;The Romans context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow the logic of Romans from chapter 1 all the way to the passages preceding this problem concept of “do not conform to the patterns of this world,” you’d find the following key concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul starts out by calling us into an obedience of faith, of believing in Christ, and as it is started with faith, it also ends with faith (Romans 1:17), or in other words: &lt;em&gt;“the just shall live by faith,”&lt;/em&gt; and this is contrary to the pattern of the world in that they live by “works,” by their performances, their human efforts to try to achieve a measure of spiritual perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he continued on to show the Romans that unrepentance is the refusal to trust in Christ alone for their salvation (Romans 2:5), and the role of the law is contrary to what they think, it does not justify but instead condemns, and no one can through the works of the law achieve God’s righteousness (Romans 3:19-20). This reliance on the law to be justified before God is again the way, or the patterns, of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Paul continued for the remainder of Romans to show people points of contrast between the way of the world and the way of faith, one or human efforts and reliance on the law and one of faith in Christ, one of law and one of grace, one of merit projected from self to one of a gift received from God (Romans 5:15-19). The way of the world will lead to boasting because it is based on the principle of works (Romans 3:27-28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in chapter 8 Paul contrasts the seeking of righteousness through the law, which is a pattern of the world, as opposed to the righteousness through Christ (Romans 10:5-13).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-real-meaning&quot;&gt;The real meaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore if we always keep in our sight the flow of thoughts that Paul presented from the beginning we’d have seen that “the patterns of the world” is not about philosophical differences between believers and unbelievers in their worldly pursuits, or of the sins they commit, but of the objects of their faith: who they trust to give them the righteousness they need to boldly come into God’s presence. The pattern of the world: works through the law vs. our pattern: grace through faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;th-gian-xc-tht-v-ti-li&quot;&gt;Thế gian, xác thịt, và tội lỗi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/do-not-conform-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phần đông nghĩ rằng thế gian, với định nghĩa chúng ta sẽ tìm hiểu thêm sau, là một điều gì đó không tốt mà chúng ta phải tránh đừng làm theo. Điều không tốt này thường được nhận định là những điều tội lỗi mà chúng ta phải gạt bỏ khỏi đời sống. Càng loại bỏ được nhiều tội lỗi chừng nào thì chúng ta càng gần Chúa chừng nấy. Hebrews 12:1 thường được nhắc đến để hỗ trợ cho luận lý rằng chúng ta phải làm mọi nỗ lực để gạt bỏ &lt;em&gt;“mọi tội lỗi dễ vấn vương.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thăm dò lướt qua các sách bình luận Kinh Thánh hiện có cho thấy chúng cũng có cùng một sự giải thích, hoặc không chừng chúng ảnh hưởng cả thế giới Tin Lành với cái nhìn đó. Nhưng thực ra người ta không cần sách bình luận Kinh Thánh để có một nhãn quan như vậy, cứ duyệt qua các tôn giáo lớn trong toàn cầu chúng ta sẽ thấy tất cả đều mang cùng một ý niệm và cách giải quyết vấn đề tội lỗi qua nhiều phương cách.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mọi tôn giáo đều mang cùng một niềm tin rằng những điều thuộc về xác thịt đều có căn bản tội lỗi, một quyền lực bóng tối mà người ta phải đè nén hoặc hủy diệt hầu có thể tiến đến bậc cao hơn về tâm linh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta không nên lấy làm lạ rằng hầu hết các tín hữu đều có cùng một sự suy tưởng mặc dầu có thể được diễn tả trong từ ngữ thích hợp với đức tin của họ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Về một phương diện chúng ta được khuyên bảo “đừng yêu thế gian (1 John 2:15), nhưng về một phương diện khác chúng ta phải sống trong đó, chung đụng với người khác trong công ăn việc làm, lái xe trên cùng một đường phố, giải trí ở cùng một rạp hát, xem cùng một đài phát hình, sưu tầm dữ kiện trên cùng mạng toàn cầu, v.v. Có thể nào những xung đột nội tại này lại không khiến cho đời sống tín hữu chịu nhiều khổ đau? Những tự kỷ ám thị đè nặng trên tâm hồn người mong muốn sống sao cho phù hợp với niềm tin mình?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đa số các sách bình luận Kinh Thánh đều dài dòng về cấu trúc của “khuôn mẫu đời này,” nhưng nói một cách đơn giản, đó là lằn ranh giữa những điều tội lỗi và không tội lỗi, phải không thưa quí vị? Do đó một cách hợp lý điều này dẫn đến sự kiện rằng mệnh lệnh “đừng làm theo đời này” có thể được đổi thành mệnh lệnh “đừng phạm tội nữa.” Hợp lý phải không quý vị? Chẳng phải đây là điều chúng ta thường nhận lãnh từ các bài giảng luận và sách vở?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thật khó để nói về thế gian mà không đồng một lúc nói đến vấn đề tội lỗi. Điều này được thể hiện trong mọi tôn giáo trong thế gian, và đạo Tin Lành cũng không thoát khỏi điều đó. Do đó nếu vấn đề “đừng làm theo đời này” được hiểu là mang cùng ý nghĩa với “đừng phạm tội nữa,” thì thà Chúa cất tín hữu khỏi thế gian là hơn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mt-mc-tiu-kh-t-c&quot;&gt;Một mục tiêu khó đạt được&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Có thể nào một người hoàn toàn tránh khỏi tội lỗi, hoặc chỉ cần hầu hết các tội lỗi? Thật dễ tìm câu trả lời trong Kinh Thánh, do đó nếu “đừng làm theo đời này” được hiểu theo ý nghĩa phổ thông, thì chúng ta tự mình chuốc lấy một cuộc sống đầy sự nản lòng và tuyệt vọng vì trong thực tế chúng ta sẽ hàng ngày đối diện với những sự vấp phạm không ngừng nghỉ. Tôi đã đọc sách về việc Martin Luther dùng 6 tiếng đồng hồ mỗi ngày để xưng tội mình, nhưng tôi tin rằng ví thử Luther hoặc vị linh mục nghe ông xưng tội có đủ sức lực e rằng ông đã xưng tội cả ngày.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vic-lm-g-p-lng-cha&quot;&gt;Việc làm gì đẹp lòng Chúa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mặc dầu các giảng sư không nói trắng ra, hầu hết người nghe đều giả dụ rằng đây là điều họ nghe: những điều thuộc về thế gian là những điều không liên hệ trực tiếp đến sự học Kinh Thánh, sinh hoạt trong hội thánh, các mục vụ, truyền giảng, cầu nguyện, v.v. Và phương cách để làm đẹp lòng Chúa là càng &lt;strong&gt;làm&lt;/strong&gt; nhiều những điều đó càng tốt. Chúng ta đọc trong John 6:28-29 rằng sau khi nghe Chúa Giê-su giảng dạy, đoàn dân hỏi Ngài về công việc của Đức Chúa Trời để họ có thể &lt;strong&gt;làm&lt;/strong&gt;. Trong Công-vụ 16:30, dân chúng hỏi sứ đồ Phao-lô họ phải &lt;strong&gt;làm&lt;/strong&gt; gì để được cứu. Nhiều người cũng đã hỏi Chúa Giê-su về điều gì họ có thể &lt;strong&gt;làm&lt;/strong&gt; trong các sách phúc âm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Có một phụ nữ trong hội thánh tôi làm việc rất cực nhọc để cung ứng cho một gia đình có nhiều người bệnh. Thỉnh thoảng trong lớp Trường Chúa Nhật cô bày tỏ sự nuối tiếc rằng mình không tìm được thời gian để “hầu việc Chúa.” Tôi đã phải cố gắng thuyết phục cô rằng công việc Chúa là những điều cô thường làm khi phục vụ khách hàng ở tiệm làm móng tay, khi cô chăm sóc cho chồng và các chị em bệnh hoạn, khi cô tìm một giây phút ngơi nghỉ giữa nhiều trọng trách. Nhưng trong lòng cô đây là những “việc của đời này” không được xứng đáng vào nước Chúa. Nhưng không phải chỉ riêng cô có ý tưởng như vậy về “đời này,” mà có lẽ hơn 99.99% người ngồi cạnh quý vị mỗi Chúa Nhật hát những bài ca ngợi khen ân điển Chúa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Từ đâu có sự hiểu biết, hoặc đúng hơn là hiểu lầm, này? Chắc chẳng đâu ngoài sự thiếu giảng dạy chân lý để đào sâu nền tảng cho các tín hữu về lời hứa tuyệt đối về sự cứu rỗi cho những kẻ xưng danh Đấng Cứu Thế. Đa số những bài giảng tôi thường nghe đều nói về những điều tín hữu nên, hoặc không nên, làm. Một số lượng quá quân bình những bài giảng chỉ chú vào những đề tài như gia đình, dạy dỗ con cái, hôn nhân, việc làm, giải trí, tình dục, và tất cả những điều được xem như tốt lành khác. Nhưng mọi điều đó, dù tốt đến đâu đi chăng nữa, chẳng phải chỉ thuộc riêng trong phạm vi đạo Chúa; vì tất cả đều tìm được trong các nguồn ngoài đạo. Đấng Christ đã không đến để giái quyết những vấn đề tạm bợ đó. Ngài đến vì một vấn đề sâu kín trong bản chất loài người. Sự chú trọng đến những vấn đề không trọng yếu đó là nguyên nhân đa số các tín hữu không được đâm sâu rễ trong Đấng Christ, và tà đạo nhờ đó tìm được đất màu mỡ để phát triển.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bi-cnh-sch-r-ma&quot;&gt;Bối cảnh sách Rô-ma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nếu chúng ta cứ theo sát luận lý của Rô-ma từ chương 1 suốt đến phần dẫn đến ý niệm “đừng làm theo đời này,” chúng ta sẽ thấy các ý chính sau đây:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phao-lô khởi đầu bằng cách gọi chúng ta đến trong sự vâng phục của đức tin, và nếu đã khởi đầu bằng đức tin thì cũng phải đi đến cùng bằng đức tin (Romans 1:17), hay nói cách khác: &lt;em&gt;“người công bình sẽ sống bởi đức tin,”&lt;/em&gt; và chân lý này thì đối nghịch với khuôn mẫu của đời này là “việc làm,” bởi những biểu dương, những nỗ lực con người để đạt được một mức toàn hảo về tâm linh nào đó.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rồi ông tiếp tục cho người Rô-ma thấy rằng sự không ăn năn tức là sự từ khước không đặt niềm tin duy nhất nơi Đấng Christ để được sự cứu rỗi (Romans 2:5), và vai trò của luật pháp thì trái ngược với điều họ thường nghĩ, là lên án thay vì đem lại sự công bình của Đức Chúa Trời (Romans 3:19-20). Sự nương cậy nơi luật pháp để được xưng công bình trước Chúa một lần nữa cũng là lề lối, hoặc khuôn mẫu, của thế gian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rồi Phao-lô tiếp tục đến hết phần còn lại của Rô-ma cho thấy những điểm tương phản giữa đường lối của thế gian và đức tin, một bên là những nỗ lực của con người và sự cậy vào luật pháp còn một bên là đức tin nơi Đấng Christ, một bên là luật pháp còn bên kia là ân điển, một bên là sự tuyên xưng công trạng của một cá nhân so với bên kia là món quà nhận từ nơi Đức Chúa Trời (Romans 5:15-19). Đường lối của thế gian sẽ dẫn đến sự khoe mình vì được đặt trên nền tảng của công đức (Romans 3:27-28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sau đó trong chương 8 Phao-lô tương phản sự tìm kiếm công bình qua luật pháp, là phương cách của thế gian, đối với sự công bình nhờ Đấng Christ (Romans 10:5-13).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ngha-chn-thc&quot;&gt;Ý nghĩa chân thực&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do đó nếu chúng ta cứ luôn giữ trong tầm mắt luồng tư tưởng mà Phao-lô đã trình bày từ lúc đầu thì chúng ta đã thấy “đời này” không nói về những khác biệt về triết lý sống giữa người tin và người không tin Chúa, hoặc ngay cả vấn đề tội lỗi, nhưng nói về đối tượng của đức tin của họ: ai là đối tượng đức tin có thể khiến họ được dạn dĩ đến trước mặt Chúa. Đường lối thế gian: việc làm do sự đòi hỏi của luật pháp, đường lối Chúa: nhờ ân điển bởi đức tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/resist-unto-blood.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The gospel sounds very attractive especially for those who have embarked on a treadmill of religion with no hope of salvation in sight. They heard of Jesus&#39; promise of water that satisfies forever, of rest for the weary, of peace that passes understanding, and how He died on the cross one time for all the sins of mankind, they thought there in this wonderful religion is their hope. But once they got into the fold, after an initial honeymoon of joy unspeakable, somehow they found themselves back on the treadmill. They&#39;re confused but couldn&#39;t quite put their fingers on what is going on. The messages they heard from pulpits for decades seemed different from what they heard when they were still in the dark. They used to hear of the forgiveness of sins, now they keep hearing stern warning of sins that they must &quot;resist unto blood.&quot; It seemed to them the Christians haven&#39;t solved their sin problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than once during these years they’ve heard messages from Hebrews 12:1-4 which left them an impression that their troubles are far from over. Memories of that first love when they knelt at the cross are all but fading. Maybe God didn’t really forgive them at all. Though the number of times they heard sermons on this passage are few, they still served to magnify the giants in the promised land, to sow the seed of doubt and fear concerning their eternal destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, &lt;u&gt;we must get rid of every weight and the sin that clings so closely&lt;/u&gt;, and run with endurance the race set out for us,  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. For the joy set out for him he endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Think of him who endured such opposition against himself by sinners, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and give up.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin&lt;/u&gt; (Hebrews 12:2-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sin-that-easily-entangles&quot;&gt;The sin that easily entangles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlined parts of these verses appear to confirm the common interpretation that we must make every effort to banish sins from our lives in order to run the race that is laid out before us. It makes sense, doesn’t it? It makes a lot of sense that a race runner must eliminate anything that can potentially affect his performance. Therefore in a Christian race, sin is a major obstacle that must be dealt with in every aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is the sin that easily entangles? Are they the sins that people commonly fall into, or some special sin—singular? We must go back to the beginning of this Hebrews letter where the author established the framework for us to determine what this sin really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in chapter 2, the author warns believer of the risk of drifting away. This gives us a clue as to what we should look for in determining what we might be drifting away from, or toward. There are more signposts all pointing to the main truth that the Hebrews author tries to point us to, and of course they also point us to what is not, but perhaps addressing just these two main topics, the sin that easily entangles, and the drifting away is sufficient for the purpose of this article. Now let us consider next the concept of drifting away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-danger-of-drifting-away&quot;&gt;The danger of drifting away&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore we must pay closer attention to &lt;strong&gt;what we have heard&lt;/strong&gt;, so that we do not &lt;strong&gt;drift away&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For if the &lt;strong&gt;message spoken through angels&lt;/strong&gt; proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty,  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;how will we escape if we &lt;strong&gt;neglect such a great salvation&lt;/strong&gt;? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him,  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will (Hebrews 2:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Christians believe that they have drifted away when work pressure, family needs, health issues, or whatever personal reasons cause them to miss church, to be unavailable for church ministries, or their falling into certain lifestyle causes much pain to themselves and others, to the point they wonder if they’re saved at all. They feel they might drift away if they don’t join every prayer meeting, if they don’t drop a substantial amount in the offering plate when a missionary came fundraising at their church, and myriad other things that they deem important to keep them on the straight and narrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever this drifting away is, it must not be one of those things mentioned above, because there is a tone of utmost urgency in verse 3: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“how will we escape?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If it is, no Christian will escape because we all will fall into one of these things that rightly or wrongly creates a fear of falling away in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s method of salvation cannot be something that is based on a shifting foundation. If He gives man &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one way to be saved&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, than their loss of salvation must be based on the failure to adhere to that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But the message we get from most Christian sources seems much more complicated than that. According to these sources, though there is one way to be saved, there are thousands of ways one can drift away to our ultimate destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will resume at a point where we determine what we might drift away from, or toward. Without a clear identification of what it is, a whole ecosystem of how-to’s may evolve with lots of bandwidth wasted without any real help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shedding-of-blood&quot;&gt;The shedding of blood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our natural tendency upon reading this part of the passage: &lt;em&gt;“You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin”&lt;/em&gt; is to think immediately of our battle against the lust of the flesh. But what does Hebrews say about bloodshed, its meaning and its purpose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 9, after the writer of Hebrews describes the role of the priest who had to enter into the most holy place to offer the blood of bulls and goats for the peoples’ sins, he went on to compare such blood to the supremacy of the blood of Christ. The inferior blood of bulls and goats only provided ritual, or ceremonial, purity, but the blood of Christ can break down the barrier between the holy of holies and the profane world of fallen flesh to give man access to God. This it does by purifying their consciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled consecrated them and provided ritual purity, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our consciences from dead works to worship the living God (Hebrews 9:13-14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the role of blood in this context be it of animals or of the Son of God? It is to give people the forgiveness they needed in their relationship with God, temporarily by one and eternally by the other. The blood of either one is for the purpose of forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore &lt;em&gt;“You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin”&lt;/em&gt; is not about struggling against sinful temptation, but about how you can pay for the sins that you have and will have committed. All men sin, the problem is how they can pay for them. In the Old Covenant, it was the bulls and goats that paid for them ceremonially, while in the New Covenant Christ paid for them now and forevermore. That is how He resists sin. Don’t you see Christ cannot be tempted because not only does He not have a sin nature, He is Almighty God. His purpose in shedding His own blood is entirely different from what contemporary pulpits try to apply to the controlling of the flesh. Additionally, we should have learned this already from the reason why the animals had to shed their blood: not for fighting against sinful temptations, but for the forgiveness of men’s sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think from this point on we can eliminate the shedding of blood from the equation. But the article cannot end here though its title is “Resist Unto Blood.” The application that is similarly derived from the concepts of “drifting away” and “the sin that easily entangles” still needs further treatment because their implication is profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-the-sin&quot;&gt;Back to “The Sin”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us ask ourselves again: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the sin that easily entangles?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The question is not what are the sins (plural), but the sin (singular), that easily entangles. It’s one specific sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time when it is written in John 16:8 that Jesus describes the role of the Holy Spirit when he comes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin … (John 16:8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is the world wrong about sin? Well the world has been thinking that sin has to do with something bad that men do, or something good that they fail to do, how can they be wrong? Jesus continued:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… in regard to sin, because they do not believe in Me (John 16:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though someone may manage to never sin as everyone else did, he is in sin, because he came from a sinful lineage, but the moment he believed in Jesus, he’s delivered from sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then years after Jesus had gone back to heaven leaving in man’s hand the ministry of reconciliation, God gave the Hebrews writer the task of reminding man once again the meaning of sin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And to whom did He swear that they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed? &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter (Hebrews 3:18-19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s rest is the place where sins are forgiven, where man with unveiled faces can be in God’s presense without shame, where man can relate to God as Abba, Father. The Hebrews writer reminded his audience of the time when God’s people arrived at the Jordan river, all they needed to do were to obey God’s command to cross the Jordan to enter the promised land. Instead of believing God’s promise to bring them to the promised land, instead of listening to Joshua and Caleb, they chose to listen to the ten other spies who reported giants in the land. This was their disobedience, this was their unbelief that prompted God’s anger when He swore that &lt;em&gt;“they would never enter His rest.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again here the Hebrews writer reaffirmed what Jesus said concerning sin: UNBELIEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the sin that easily entangles. That is the sin that causes so many folks to not believing in Jesus’ promise of salvation to those who believe in Him. This is the sin that crops up from ministries that are supposed to reconcile men to God but instead caused them to further drift from God, when they proved themselves wrong concerning sin by focusing all their energy in fighting a wrong battle, when they focus on the sins (plural) instead of helping folks to firmly believe in the one that God had sent (John 6:29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-drift-away-&quot;&gt;The drift away …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us revisit Hebrews 2:1 which says: &lt;em&gt;“Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.”&lt;/em&gt; What had they heard? What but the simple truth that the ultimate sin is the sin of unbelief? Didn’t they hear that those who have the Son have eternal life (1 John 5:2)? Didn’t they remember what happened to those who didn’t cross the Jordan to enter the promise land because of their unbelief? Didn’t they remember what Jesus said when He still walked among them saying the real sin is the sin of not believing in Him (John 16:8)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t drift away from that simple but everlasting truth: Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Don’t add anything to it, and don’t take anything away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shedding of blood has nothing to do with battling against the flesh, but it has to do with the forgiveness of sin that only Jesus can provide. The shedding of blood is not something that you’re allowed to do; only the unblemished bulls or goats of the Old Covenant could, and only the Son of God could in the New Covenant. Who are you to try to shed your own blood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sin that easily entangles is the sin of unbelief, of not putting your full trust of your salvation in Christ’s finished work on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t drift away from that simple but glorious truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 12:4. Ý nghĩa của câu Kinh Thánh &quot;Trong cuộc chiến đấu với tội lỗi, anh chị em chống cự chưa đến mức đổ máu.&quot;? Phải chăng mục đích của đời sống tín hữu là chống trả với tội lỗi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrews&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgba(0,0,0,0);&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;12:4 viết: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Trong cuộc chiến đấu với tội lỗi, anh chị em chống cự chưa đến mức đổ máu.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; và trên khắp địa cầu, sứ điệp phổ thông từ các tòa giảng khắp nơi đều nói rằng, bằng mọi giá, chúng ta phải chống trả tội lỗi dù có phải đổ máu, dù có phải hy sinh mạng sống. Bài viết này sẽ chứng minh rằng những giải thích phổ thông này đều sai lầm, và gây ra biết bao đau đớn và hoang mang cho những người đang tìm cách sống cho xứng đáng với sự cứu rỗi mà họ nhận được.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phn-m-u&quot;&gt;Phần mở đầu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/resist-unto-blood.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Phúc Âm nghe rất hấp dẫn nhất là đối với những kẻ đã từng lao lực trên con đường tôn giáo mà chẳng có hy vọng gì về sự cứu rỗi. Họ nghe nói về lời hứa của Chúa Giê-su về nước hằng sống, về sự an nghỉ cho người mệt mỏi vì gánh nặng, về sự bình an vượt ngoài sự hiểu biết, và về sự Chúa đã chịu chết để cất đi gánh nặng tội lỗi của cả nhân loai, và họ đặt niềm hy vọng vào tôn giáo tuyệt vời đó. Nhưng một khi họ vào trong niềm tin, sau một giai đoạn trăng mật với niềm vui khó tả, chợt họ thấy mình lại quay về trên con đường cũ. Họ bối rối nhưng không biết rõ điều gì thực sự đã xảy ra. Những sự giảng dạy họ nghe từ các tòa giảng những thập niên qua nghe dường như khác với điều họ đã nghe khi còn bước đi trong tăm tối. Họ đã thường được nghe về sự tha thứ tội lỗi, bây giờ họ chỉ nghe về những cảnh cáo về tội lỗi mà họ phải &quot;chống trả dù có phải đổ máu.&quot; Đối với họ, những người tín hữu Cơ-đốc vẫn chưa giải quyết được vấn đề tội lỗi.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đã hơn một lần trong những năm tháng đó họ đã nghe những lời giảng dạy từ Hebrews 12:1-4 để lại trong lòng họ một ấn tượng rằng những nan đề của họ vẫn còn đó. Ký ức của tình yêu ban đầu khi họ quỳ gối dưới chân thập tự giờ chỉ còn là một bóng mờ. Chắc Chúa đã chẳng thực sự tha thứ họ đâu. Mặc dầu số lần họ nghe những bài giảng đó chỉ đếm trên đầu ngón tay, nhưng cũng đủ để họ thấy những người khổng lồ trong đất hứa, đủ để hạt giống nghi ngờ và sợ hãi về số phận đời đời của họ được nẩy mầm và phát triển.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy nên, vì chúng ta có cả một đám mây nhân chứng rất lớn bao quanh, &lt;u&gt;hãy vứt bỏ mọi gánh nặng và tội lỗi dễ vấn vương&lt;/u&gt;, kiên trì chạy trong cuộc đua đã dành sẵn cho mình.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Hãy chú tâm, hướng về Đức Giê-su là Đấng Tác Giả và hoàn thành của đức tin. Vì niềm vui mừng đặt trước mặt, Ngài chịu đựng thập tự giá, khinh điều sỉ nhục, nên được ngồi bên phải ngai Đức Chúa Trời.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Hãy suy nghiệm về Đấng đã đương đầu với sự chống đối của những kẻ tội lỗi như thế để anh chị em khỏi mệt mỏi, ngã lòng. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trong cuộc chiến đấu với tội lỗi, anh chị em chống cự chưa đến mức đổ máu&lt;/u&gt; (Hebrews 12:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ti-li-d-vn-vng&quot;&gt;Tội lỗi dễ vấn vương&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Những phần có gạch dưới trong đoạn Kinh thánh trên dường như xác định lối giải thích phổ thông rằng chúng ta phải bằng mọi cách gạt bỏ hết những gánh nặng, hoặc tội lỗi, hầu có thể chạy cuộc đua bày ra trước mắt chúng ta. Nghe rất hợp lý phải không quý bạn đọc? Sự một người phải tìm cách loại bỏ tất cả những điều có thể ảnh hưởng cuộc chạy của mình là một điều hợp với lẽ thường tình. Do đó trong cuộc chạy của người tín hữu, tội lỗi là một ngăn trở lớn mà người đó phải vượt thắng về mọi phương diện.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nhưng tội lỗi dễ vấn vương đó là gì? Phải chăng là những tội lỗi mà người đời thường phạm phải, hay là một tội nào đó? Chúng ta phải trở về phần đầu của sách Hebrews ở điểm mà tác giả thiết lập nền tảng hầu giúp chúng ta xác định tội này là tội gì.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong chương 2, tác giả cảnh cáo tín hữu về nguy cơ của sự “trôi lạc.” Điều này cho chúng ta một dấu hiệu hầu giúp chúng ta xác định điểm mà từ đó chúng ta có thể bị trôi lạc. Có thêm nhiều điểm quan trọng mà tác giả Hebrews đã trình bày có thể hỗ trợ thêm trong sự xác định điểm đó, nhưng có lẽ chúng ta chỉ cần làm sáng tỏ hai điểm chính, là tội lỗi dễ vấn vương và sự trôi lạc thì cũng đủ để đạt được mục đích của bài viết này. Bây giờ chúng ta hãy suy xét về ý niệm kế tiếp là sự “trôi lạc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nguy-c-tri-lc&quot;&gt;Nguy cơ trôi lạc&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy nên, chúng ta phải càng giữ vững lấy điều mình đã nghe e kẻo bị &lt;u&gt;trôi lạc&lt;/u&gt; chăng.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Vì nên lời thiên sứ rao truyền đã vững chắc và sự trái phép nghịch mạng đã được báo ứng xứng đáng rồi,  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;mà nếu ta còn trễ nải sự cứu rỗi lớn dường ấy, thì &lt;u&gt;làm sao tránh cho khỏi được?&lt;/u&gt; là sự cứu rỗi Chúa truyền ra trước hết, rồi có những kẻ nghe chứng nghiệm nó cho chúng ta,  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Chúa Trời cũng dùng những dấu kỳ sự lạ và đủ thứ phép mầu, lại dùng sự ban cho của Ðức Thánh Linh mà Ngài đã theo ý muốn mình phát ra, để làm chứng với các kẻ đó (Hebrews 2:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đa số các tín hữu tin rằng họ đã bị trôi lạc khi công ăn việc làm, tình trạng gia cảnh, sức khỏe, hoặc bất cứ điều riêng tư gì khiến họ không đến nơi thờ phượng được thường xuyên, khiến họ không tham dự được những mục vụ trong hội thánh, hoặc sự sa ngã của họ về một phương diện nào đó đem lại nhiều khổ đau cho bản thân và gia đình, đến nỗi họ tự hỏi mình có thực sự được cứu không. Họ cảm thấy họ có thể bị trôi lạc nếu họ không tham dự mỗi buổi nhóm cầu nguyện, nếu không dâng một số tiền nào đó đáng kể khi có giáo sĩ đến thăm hội thánh, và hằng hà sa số những điều khác quan trọng trong tầm mắt họ để giữ họ trong đường thẳng và hẹp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nhưng bất kể sự trôi lạc này là gì, nó không thể là những sự kể trên, vì câu 3 ở trên bao hàm một sự cấp bách: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“làm sao tránh cho khỏi được?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Lại nếu sự trôi lạc này là một trong những điều kể trên thì chẳng tín hữu nào được cứu vì mọi người đều không ít thì nhiều trải qua những trường hợp đem lại sự sợ hãi bị trôi lạc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chương trình cứu rỗi của Chúa không thể nào lại đặt trên một nền tảng hay dời đổi. Nếu Chúa cho nhân loại &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;một con đường để được cứu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, thì hẳn sự hư mất chắc phải dựa trên sự không đi theo con đường đó. Nhưng sứ điệp chúng ta nhận từ đa số các nguồn trong đạo đều không đơn giản như vậy. Theo các nguồn này, mặc dù chỉ có một con đường cứu rỗi, nhưng có hằng ngàn điều có thể dẫn chúng ta đến sự hư mất.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta sẽ quay trở lại tại một điểm mà ở đó chúng ta xác định sự trôi lạc. Nếu không có một sự nhận diện chính xác sự trôi lạc từ đâu, thì cả một guồng máy lợi dụng sự mơ hồ đó đem lợi đến cho những kẻ lợi dụng sự non nớt của tín hữu, tốn thì giờ và tiền bạc mà chẳng đem lại lợi ích gì.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;s--huyt&quot;&gt;Sự đổ huyết&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khuynh hướng tự nhiên của chúng ta là khi đọc phần này của đoạn Kinh thánh: &lt;em&gt;“Trong cuộc chiến đấu với tội lỗi, anh chị em chống cự chưa đến mức đổ máu”&lt;/em&gt; thì chúng ta nghĩ ngay đến sự vật lộn với xác thịt. Nhưng sách Hê-bơ-rơ nói gì về sự đổ huyết, về ý nghĩa và mục đích của nó?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong chương 9, sau khi tác giả sách Hebrews miêu tả vai trò của thầy tế lễ vào nơi chí thánh để dâng huyết chiên và bò đực vì tội lỗi của dân sự, liền so sánh huyết đó với sự mầu nhiệm tuyệt đối của huyết Đấng Christ. Huyết hèn yếu của chiên và bò đực chỉ mang lại sự trong sạch tạm thời về nghi lễ, nhưng huyết của Đấng Christ có hiệu năng phá bỏ bức màn ngăn cách giữa nơi chí thánh và xác thịt hay hư nát hầu nhân loại được đến gần Đức Chúa Trời. Huyết đó thực hiện được điều này qua sự rửa sạch lương tâm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Vì nếu huyết của dê đực cùng tro bò cái tơ mà người ta rưới trên kẻ ô uế còn làm sạch được phần xác thịt họ và nên thánh thay,  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;huống chi huyết của Ðấng Christ, là Ðấng nhờ Ðức Thánh Linh đời đời, dâng chính mình không tì tích cho Ðức Chúa Trời, thì sẽ &lt;u&gt;làm sạch lương tâm anh em khỏi công việc chết, đặng hầu việc Ðức Chúa Trời hằng sống&lt;/u&gt;, là dường nào! (Hebrews 9:13-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vai trò của huyết trong bối cảnh này, hoặc của súc vật hoặc của Con Một Đức Chúa Trời, là gì? Huyết đó đem lại cho loài người sự tha tội cần thiết trong mối liên hệ với Đức Chúa Trời, một huyết đem lại giải pháp tạm thời còn huyết kia tẩy sạch đời đời. Cả hai đều nhằm mục đich tha tội.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do đó &lt;em&gt;“Trong cuộc chiến đấu với tội lỗi, anh chị em chống cự chưa đến mức đổ máu”&lt;/em&gt; không nói về sự đương đầu với những cám dỗ, nhưng về sự trả giá cho tội lỗi mà mình đã và sẽ còn phạm tiếp tục mãi. Mọi người đều phạm tội, vấn đề là làm sao họ có thể trả giá cho tội đó. Trong Cựu Ước, giá này được trả nhờ huyết chiên và bò đực về phần nghi lễ, còn dưới Tân Ước Chúa Giê-su đã trả hiện tại và cho đến mãi về sau. Đó là cách Chúa Giê-su chống trả với tội lỗi. Các bạn đọc có nhận thức rằng Chúa Giê-su không thể nào bị cám dỗ vì Ngài không mang bản chất tội lỗi, và Ngài chính là Đức Chúa Trời. Mục đích của sự đổ huyết của Ngài hoàn toàn khác với những luận lý từ các tòa giảng chỉ chuyên hướng về sự kềm hãm xác thịt. Hơn nữa, đúng ra chúng ta có thể thấy điều này qua sự đổ huyết của các của lễ: chẳng phải để chống lại sự cám dỗ, nhưng để tha tội.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tôi thiển nghĩ từ điểm này trở đi chúng ta có thể loại bỏ vấn đề đổ huyết khỏi bài toán mà chúng ta đang tìm cách phân giải. Nhưng bài viết này không thể chấm dứt tại đây mặc dù tựa đề của nó là dựa trên ý niệm “chống cự đến nỗi đổ huyết.” Những áp dụng rút tỉa một cách tương tự từ các ý niệm về “sự trôi lạc” và “tội lỗi dễ vấn vương” vẫn còn cần được làm cho sáng tỏ thêm vì ảnh hưởng sâu đậm của chúng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tr-li-vi-vn--ti-li&quot;&gt;Trở lại với vấn đề “tội lỗi”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta tự hỏi một lần nữa: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tội lỗi dễ vấn vương là gì?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Câu hỏi này không nói về &lt;u&gt;những&lt;/u&gt; tội lỗi (số nhiều), nhưng nói về tội lỗi (số ít). Nó nói về một tội lỗi duy nhất.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ngày xưa có lời viết trong John 16:8 rằng Chúa Giê-su miêu tả vai trò của Đức Thánh Linh khi Ngài đến như sau:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Khi Ngài đến thì sẽ khiến thế gian nhìn nhận họ sai lầm về tội lỗi … (John 16:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thế gian đã sai lầm về tội lỗi như thế nào? Chẳng phải thế gian vẫn thường nghĩ rằng tội lỗi là những điều sai lầm mà họ làm, hoặc những điều lành mà họ không làm, thì họ sai ở chỗ nào? Chúa Giê-su phán tiếp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Về tội lỗi, &lt;u&gt;vì họ không tin ta&lt;/u&gt; (John 16:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cho dù một người nào đó có tránh phạm những tội mà người ta thường phạm, thì họ cũng vẫn ở trong tội lỗi, vì họ vốn sinh ra trong sự hư nát, nhưng khi họ đặt niềm tin nơi Chúa Giê-su thì Ngài giải phóng họ khỏi tội lỗi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rồi nhiều năm sau khi Chúa Giê-su trở về trời để lại cho loài người sứ mạng giảng hòa, thì Ngài cho tác giả sách Hê-bơ-rơ nhiệm vụ nhắc nhở loài người một lần nữa về ý nghĩa của tội lỗi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Ngài lại thề với ai rằng &lt;u&gt;không được vào sự yên nghỉ&lt;/u&gt; của Ngài? Há chẳng phải với những người không vâng lời sao?  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Vả, chúng ta thấy những người ấy không thể vào đó được &lt;u&gt;vì cớ không tin&lt;/u&gt; (Hebrews 3:18-19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nơi yên nghỉ của Chúa là nơi mà tội lỗi được thứ tha, nơi loài người với mặt trần không che phủ được ở trong sự hiện diện của Chúa mà không xấu hổ, nơi họ được gọi Đức Chúa Trời là Cha. Tác giả Hê-bơ-rơ nhắc nhở độc giả về ngày mà dân Chúa đến trước bờ sông Giô-đanh, họ chỉ cần vâng lời Chúa bước qua sông thì được vào đất hứa. Nhưng thay vì tin lời hứa của Chúa rằng Ngài sẽ cho họ vào đất hứa, thay vì tin lời làm chứng của Giô-suê và Ca-lép, họ chọn để nghe lời mười thám tử thuật lại về những người khổng lồ họ thấy trong đất đó. Đó là sự không vâng lời của họ, đó là sự chẳng tin đã gợi cơn thịnh nộ của Đức Chúa Trời khi Ngài thề rằng họ sẽ &lt;em&gt;“chẳng bao giờ được vào nơi an nghỉ của Ngài”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do đó lại thêm một lần tác giả Hê-bơ-rơ xác định điều Chúa Giê-su nói về tội lỗi: CHẲNG TIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đó chính là tội lỗi dễ vấn vương. Đó là tội gây cho nhiều tín hữu không tin vào lời hứa về sự cứu rỗi của Chúa Giê-su cho những kẻ tin Ngài. Đây chính là tội lỗi mà nhiều mục vụ đã phạm khi chính ra họ phải giảng hòa giữa Đức Chúa Trời và loài người thì lại khiến họ xa cách Ngài hơn, khi họ không nhìn nhận sự sai lầm của họ về vấn đề tội lỗi qua sự họ chỉ dành hết nỗ lực cho một chiến trận sai lầm, khi họ chú tâm về tội lỗi (số nhiều) thay vì giúp các tín hữu quyết tin nơi Đấng mà Đức Chúa Trời sai đến (John 6:29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;s-tri-lc-&quot;&gt;Sự trôi lạc …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta hãy trở lại với đoạn Hebrews 2:1 viết như sau: &lt;em&gt;“Vậy nên, chúng ta phải càng giữ vững lấy &lt;u&gt;điều mình đã nghe&lt;/u&gt; e kẻo bị trôi lạc chăng.”&lt;/em&gt; Điều gì họ đã nghe? Còn điều gì ngoài chân lý đơn sơ rằng tội lỗi tóm lại là tội chẳng tin? Chẳng phải họ đã nghe rằng ai có Chúa Giê-su thì có sự sống (1 John 5:2)? Họ đã không nhớ những điều đã xảy ra cho những kẻ không vượt sông Giô-đanh để vào đất hứa vì tội chẳng tin sao? Họ đã không nhớ điều Chúa Giê-su đã nói khi Ngài còn sống trong vòng họ phán rằng tội thật là tội không đặt niềm tin nơi Ngài (John 16:8)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đừng trôi lạc khỏi chn lý đơn sơ nhưng vĩnh cửu đó: Chúa Giê-su là Con Đường, Chân Lý, và Nguồn Sống. Đừng thêm gì vào đó, cũng đừng lấy điều gì đi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kt-lun&quot;&gt;Kết Luận&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sự đổ huyết chẳng liên hệ gì đến sự chống lại những cám dỗ của tội lỗi, nhưng liên hệ đến sự tha thứ tội lỗi mà chỉ mình Chúa Giê-su mới có thể ban cho. Sự đổ huyết không phải là điều mà chúng ta được phép làm; chỉ ngoại trừ huyết của chiên và bò đực không tì vết của thời Cựu Ước, và của Con Một Đức Chúa Trời trong Tân Ước. Chúng ta là gì mà đòi đổ huyết?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tội lỗi dễ vấn vương là tội chẳng tin, chẳng đặt trọn niềm tin nơi sự cứu rỗi được ban cho bởi việc Chúa Giê-su đã làm trọn trên thập tự giá.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Và đừng trôi lạc khỏi chân lý đơn sơ nhưng vinh hiển đó.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surrender. Rest. Peace. Letting go. But if the Bible says that the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, then how can you surrender to God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dilemma&quot;&gt;The dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/surrender.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #666666; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
All Christians experience to a varying degree great conflicts between their desire to do the will of God and their inability to do so. The theme Surrender is well visited by various authors through the ages from both Christian and secular sources. To the Christians the ability to surrender means many things; from being able to say no to temptations, to being obedient to what one might deem as the will of God in their lives, to being able to overcome many character flaws that had plagued them since the time their need for a deliverance nudged them toward the place of trust in God.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul not only described these struggles in the two letters he wrote to the Galatians and the Romans, he also showed us how we may find a solution. The goal of this article is to show that though it is indeed a very desirable and profitable thing to surrender to God, it is never intended to be a goal to be achieved, but instead it is realized by the believers as a byproduct, a fruit, of a much more important thing, a change in mindset, or outlook, in how we walk with God, from law-based obedience to grace-based empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paul-to-the-galatians&quot;&gt;Paul to the Galatians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul declared a statement of the fact concerning the reality of the flesh in our lives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that &lt;u&gt;ye cannot do the things that ye would&lt;/u&gt; (Galatians 5:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this verse we clearly read that our flesh’s desire is not the things of God, so it will not voluntarily surrender to God, and the end result is &lt;em&gt;“ye cannot do the things that ye would.”&lt;/em&gt; But most Christians think otherwise, that they can somehow muster the strength to do the things Paul said they couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote this as a statement of fact, without exception, which will be further reinforced when we next study the following Romans passage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paul-to-the-romans&quot;&gt;Paul to the Romans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do … &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;So I find this law at work&lt;/u&gt;: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin&lt;/u&gt; (Romans 7:15,21-25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul again describes the same thing he does in Galatians, but here he calls it a law, and a law is just what it is, it cannot fail, like the law of gravity, or other laws that describes the universe. But here Paul goes further to explain why this is the case. The reason being we are made up of two parts: 1) the inner being, the spirit, or the mind, and 2) the flesh, and they are in constant struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 25 appears to show us a resolution to the conflict, with presumably the flesh to be on the losing side when it wrote: &lt;em&gt;“Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!”&lt;/em&gt; But is this really the case? No, this is not the case at all, because if we continue to read to the second part we’d find the opposite to be true, where Paul confirmed the reality of the existence of our two parts side by side: the flesh and the spirit, when he wrote: &lt;em&gt;“So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mind, or our spirit, the part that comes alive when we received Christ and the Holy Spirit as a seal of our redemption, loves and obey the law of God. This part does not have any trouble in such a way that it needs to surrender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our flesh, our sinful nature, is a slave to the law of sin. Notice the use of the term SLAVE, which suggests a total submission to this law which makes resistance to it an impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul reiterates the inability of the flesh to submit to God later in Romans 8 as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their outlook shaped by the things of the Spirit.  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;For the outlook of the flesh is death, but the outlook of the Spirit is life and peace,  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God, for it &lt;u&gt;does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so&lt;/u&gt; (Romans 8:5-7—NET).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we read that besides the fact that the flesh does not submit to the law of God, it’s unable to do so even if it does desire it. There is a very thorough discussion of the “outlook of the flesh” in the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/bible-topics/meditations/put-to-death-the-deeds-of-the-body/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;u&gt;Mortify the Deeds of the Flesh&lt;/u&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which helps us see a more harmful aspect of the flesh not as instrument for sins, but as instrument for righteouness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-put-jesus-in-control&quot;&gt;To put Jesus in control?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can put this question another way: Can you surrender to God? Here the old hymn “Fully Surrender” came to mind with the following lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fully surrendered—Lord, I would be,&lt;br /&gt;
Fully surrendered, dear Lord, to Thee.&lt;br /&gt;
All on the altar laid,&lt;br /&gt;
Surrender fully made,&lt;br /&gt;
Thou hast my ransom paid;&lt;br /&gt;
I yield to Thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hymn suggests a willingness, and a decision is made, by the surrendering person to submit to God. But what did Paul write about the flesh? We learned from the Galatians and Romans passages that the flesh will not, and cannot, submit to the law of God. So if we apply Paul’s reasoning to the hymn, though its author may want to surrender to God, his or her flesh &lt;em&gt;“does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so.”&lt;/em&gt; This hymn reflects the sentiment of the majority of Christians who are tired of the constant struggles and simply want to lay down and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul suggests we do not try to control the flesh, but to walk in the Spirit. We overcome the flesh by not doing battle with it, by not focusing on putting it under submission, but to walk in the Spirit. It will become clearer as we enter the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;walk-in-the-spirit&quot;&gt;Walk in the Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it has become clear that the focus of ministries should NOT be on the taming of the uncontrollable flesh because the volume of truth we’ve read has shown the futility of doing so. Let us expand the context surrounding Galatians 5:17 to see the solution fo the problem of surrender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;So I say, &lt;u&gt;walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whateverc you want. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;But &lt;u&gt;if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law&lt;/u&gt; (Galatians 5:16-18).`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Paul shows us how to NOT gratify the desires of the flesh, or in other words to achieve a state of surrender, by walking by the spirit instead of doing battle with the flesh which will not submit to the law of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean to walk by the spirit? To pray all the time? To consciously put oneself in God’s presence? Read more Bible? Practicing God’s Presence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What motivates someone to wish for a state of surrender? Isn’t it because of the constant struggle against what that they hate but end up doing anyway because the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still one more important point that we can easily miss in verse 18: &lt;em&gt;“But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.”&lt;/em&gt; It is the law that amplifies the struggle with the flesh, just like it is written in 1 Corinthians 15:56 which says &lt;em&gt;“the power of sin is the law.”&lt;/em&gt; When someone lives under the law, there is a need to control the flesh, to put it into submission, to make it do the impossible: to submit to the law of God. Verse 18 shows us that it’s the law that puts one in this constant struggle, but you can be set free from the law by walking in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we must ask ourselves what is the role of the Holy Spirit in our relationship with God? Jesus describes the role of the Holy Spirit as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment – &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;concerning sin, because they do not believe in me&lt;/u&gt;; (John 16:8-9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus made it simple for us to understand the true meaning of sin, of what separates us from God. So in explaining the role of the Holy Spirit, Jesus shows us that sin is the act of not believing in Him; when someone places their trust in Christ, sin is no longer an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one walks according to God’s new law: the law of the spirit of life, which says he who believes on the Son will have eternal life (John 3:36), one experiences a rest from the never ending treadmill of performance where a sense of surrender comes without effort, like a child resting in its mother’s arms. That is how we walk by the spirit. That is how we surrender; not by struggling against flesh and blood (Ephesians 6:12), but by faith, by trusting in Christ’s finished work on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To surrender from a flesh-based perspective is a never-ending process which will not get one to the place of true yielding to God, but to walk by the Spirit is a once for all act of placing our trust in Christ: It’s Finished! If the world has been wrong concerning sin, it has also been wrong concerning their trying to surrender. Because sin is not about transgressions, but about unbelief in Christ, so it is with surrender, it is not about trying to overcome the flesh, but it’s about resting in the finished work of Christ. One is a never ending treadmill of repeated sacrifices, the other is a once-for-all act by the One who comes from God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Làm sao chúng ta có thể đầu phục Chúa nếu &lt;em&gt;&quot;xác thịt có những dục vọng trái với Thánh Linh&quot;&lt;/em&gt; (Galatians 5:17) và: &lt;em&gt;&quot;… tôi không hiểu điều mình làm: tôi chẳng làm điều mình muốn, nhưng làm điều mình ghét (Romans 7:15).&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vn--nan-gii&quot;&gt;Vấn đề nan giải&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/surrender.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Mỗi người tín hữu đều trải qua ở một mức độ nào đó những xung đột giữa lòng ước muốn sống theo ý Chúa và sự bất lực của mình. Đề tài Đầu Phục thường được nói đến từ các nguồn ngoài cũng như trong đạo Chúa. Đối với người tín hữu, khả năng đầu phục Chúa mang nhiều ý nghĩa khác nhau; từ sự chống lại được những cám dỗ, đến sự vâng theo những điều người đó nghĩ là ý Chúa trong đời sống họ, đến khả năng vượt thắng được những bản tính xấu đã từng gây khó khăn cho họ khiến họ phải đến đặt niềm tin nơi Chúa.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phao-lô không phải chỉ viết về những xung đột trong hai thơ Ga-la-ti và Rô-ma, ông cũng chỉ cho chúng ta biết làm sao tìm được giải pháp cho nan đề đó. Mục đích của bài viết này là để cho thấy rằng mặc dầu sự đầu phục Chúa là điều tốt, nó không phải là mục tiêu của đời sống tin kính, mà trái lại người tín hữu sẽ đạt được sự đầu phục, sự yên nghỉ đó một cách gián tiếp, như là kết quả đến bởi một điều rất quan trọng hơn, một sự biến hóa bởi sự đổi mới của tâm thần, một cái nhìn mới, về sự bước đi với Chúa, từ sự vâng lời đặt nền tảng trên luật pháp đến sự nhận quyền năng bởi ân điển.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;th-gi-hi-thnh-ga-la-ti&quot;&gt;Thơ gửi hội thánh Ga-la-ti&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phao-lô tuyên bố về sự hiện diện của xác thịt trong đời sống chúng ta:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Vì xác thịt có những điều ưa muốn trái với của Thánh Linh, Thánh Linh có những điều ưa muốn trái với của xác thịt; hai bên trái nhau dường ấy, nên anh em không làm được điều mình muốn làm (Galatians 5:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta nhận thấy rõ qua đoạn này là những dục vọng của xác thịt khác với ý muốn của Chúa, do đó nó sẽ không tự nguyện đầu phục Chúa, và kết quả là chúng ta “không làm được điều mình muốn làm.” Nhưng đa số các tín hữu không nghĩ như vậy, họ nghĩ mình có thể bằng một cách nào đó vận dụng nỗ lực để đạt được điều mà sứ đồ Phao-lô nói họ không làm được.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phao-lô viết như một lời tuyên bố về một chân lý không dời đổi, và chúng ta sẽ vững tin về điều này hơn nữa khi học đến đoạn Rô-ma sắp tới.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;th-gi-hi-thnh-r-ma&quot;&gt;Thơ gửi hội thánh Rô-ma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;Vì tôi không hiểu điều mình làm: tôi chẳng làm điều mình muốn, nhưng làm điều mình ghét… &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy tôi thấy có luật nầy trong tôi: khi tôi muốn làm điều lành, thì điều dữ dính dấp theo tôi. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Vì theo người bề trong, tôi vẫn lấy luật pháp Ðức Chúa Trời làm đẹp lòng; &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;nhưng tôi cảm biết trong chi thể mình có một luật khác giao chiến với luật trong trí mình, bắt mình phải làm phu tù cho luật của tội lỗi, tức là luật ở trong chi thể tôi vậy. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Khốn nạn cho tôi! Ai sẽ cứu tôi thoát khỏi thân thể hay chết nầy? &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Cảm tạ Ðức Chúa Trời, nhờ Ðức Chúa Jêsus Christ, là Chúa chúng ta! Như vậy, thì chính mình tôi lấy trí khôn phục luật pháp của Ðức Chúa Trời, nhưng lấy xác thịt phục luật pháp của tội lỗi (Romans 7:15,21-25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phao-lô lại nói về sự xung đột mà ông đã diễn tả trong Ga-la-ti, nhưng ở đây ông gọi đó là một luật, mà khi đã nói về luật thì nói về tính cách không dời đổi của nó, như luật về trọng lực hoặc sức hút của địa cầu, hoặc những luật khác điều khiển vũ trụ. Nhưng trong đoạn này Phao-lô giải thích thêm lý do của nan đề chung của nhân loại. Sự xung đột hiện hữu vì chúng ta có hai phần: 1) phần trong, tâm linh, hoặc tâm trí, và 2) phần xác, và hai phần luôn luôn xung đột với nhau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Câu 25 dường như chỉ cho chúng ta một giải quyết cho cuộc xung đột, với giả định rằng xác thịt bị đánh ngã như được viết rằng: “Cảm tạ Ðức Chúa Trời, nhờ Ðức Chúa Jêsus Christ, là Chúa chúng ta!” Nhưng có phải thực vậy không? Không, hoàn toàn không, vì nếu chúng ta đọc tiếp đến phần sau của câu 25 chúng ta sẽ thấy điều đối nghịch khi Phao-lô xác định sự hiện hữu của hai phần trong chúng ta luôn luôn đi đôi với nhau: xác thịt và tâm linh, khi ông viết: “Như vậy, thì chính mình tôi lấy trí khôn phục luật pháp của Ðức Chúa Trời, nhưng lấy xác thịt phục luật pháp của tội lỗi.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tâm trí, hoặc tâm linh, phần trở nên sống động khi chúng ta tiếp nhận Đấng Christ và Thánh Linh làm ấn chứng cho chúng ta trong ngày cứu chuộc, thì vốn yêu quý và tuân theo luật pháp Đức Chúa Trời. Phần này không cần phải được trợ giúp để đầu phục Chúa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Còn phần xác thịt của chúng ta, phần thuộc bản chất tội lỗi, vốn là nô lệ dưới luật của tội lỗi. Hãy để ý đến cách dùng chữ NÔ LỆ, bày tỏ sự đầu phục hoàn toàn dưới luật đó khiến sự chống trả lại luật đó là một điều không thể xảy ra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phao-lô nhắc lại sự xác thịt không thể đầu phục Chúa trong Rô-ma đoạn 8 như sau:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Thật thế, kẻ sống theo xác thịt thì chăm những sự thuộc về xác thịt; còn kẻ sống theo Thánh Linh thì chăm những sự thuộc về Thánh Linh. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Vả, chăm về xác thịt sanh ra sự chết, còn chăm về Thánh Linh sanh ra sự sống và bình an; &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;vì sự chăm về xác thịt nghịch với Ðức Chúa Trời, bởi nó không phục dưới luật pháp Ðức Chúa Trời, lại cũng không thể phục được (Romans 8:5-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ở đây chúng ta đọc được rằng ngoài một thực trạng rằng xác thịt không chịu phục dưới luật pháp Đức Chúa Trời, nó cũng không thể phục được dù có thực sự muốn đi chăng nữa. Đây là một bài thảo luận rất đầy đủ về sự bước đi theo xác thịt: “Làm chết các việc của chi thể” có thể giúp chúng ta thấy một khía cạnh tai hại hơn về xác thịt, không phải để làm khí cụ cho tội tỗi, nhưng làm một khí cụ để đạt được sự công bình.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cha-lo-li-cuc-i&quot;&gt;Để Chúa lèo lái cuộc đời?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta có thể nêu câu hỏi này cách khác: Bạn có thể đầu phục Chúa được không? Đến đây chúng ta nhớ đến lời của bài hát “Tận Hiến” với câu đầu viết như sau:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Xin nguyện dâng chính con, Chúa đoái nhậm lời,&lt;br /&gt;
Jê-sus thân ái ôi, quyết dâng trọn đời; &lt;br /&gt;
Muôn sự dâng ở bàn thờ, &lt;br /&gt;
Xin vui dâng Chúa bây giờ, &lt;br /&gt;
Huyết Chúa mua thân, hồn này, &lt;br /&gt;
Nguyện đầu phục Ngài.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lời bài hát nói lên sự sẵn lòng, một quyết định, của một người muốn tự mình đầu phục Chúa. Nhưng sứ đồ Phao-lô đã nói gì về bản chất tội lỗi của chúng ta? Từ Ga-la-ti và Rô-ma chúng ta nhận biết rằng xác thịt sẽ không bao giờ, và không thể, đầu phục luật pháp Đức Chúa Trời. Do đó nếu chúng ta áp dụng luận lý của Phao-lô vào bài hát này, thì dầu tác giả có muốn đầu phục Chúa, xác thịt của người đó cũng “không phục dưới luật pháp Ðức Chúa Trời, lại cũng không thể phục được.” Bài hát này phản ảnh tâm trạng của đa số tín hữu đã mệt mỏi về sự xung đột không ngừng và chỉ muốn tìm được nơi an nghỉ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sứ đồ Phao-lô khuyên chúng ta đừng tìm cách khắc phục xác thịt, nhưng bước đi trong Thánh Linh. Chúng ta thắng hơn được xác thịt không phải qua sự chiến đấu với nó bằng cách bắt nó phải phục, nhưng bước đi trong Thánh Linh. Điều này sẽ rõ ràng hơn khi chúng ta đi vào đoạn kế tiếp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bc-i-trong-thnh-linh&quot;&gt;Bước đi trong Thánh Linh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi vọng đến đây chúng ta thấy rõ rằng trọng tâm của mục vụ KHÔNG PHẢI là sự bắt phục một thân xác bất khuất, vì số lượng của những chân lý chúng ta đã đọc cho thấy đó là một việc phí công vô ích. Chúng ta hãy mở rộng bối cảnh chung quanh Galatians 5:17 hầu có thể tìm thấy giải pháp cho nan đề này.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy tôi nói rằng: &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Hãy bước đi theo Thánh Linh, chớ hề làm trọn những điều ưa muốn của xác thịt. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Vì xác thịt có những điều ưa muốn trái với của Thánh Linh, Thánh Linh có những điều ưa muốn trái với của xác thịt; hai bên trái nhau dường ấy, nên anh em không làm được điều mình muốn làm. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Nhưng, ví bằng anh em nhờ Thánh Linh chỉ dẫn, thì chẳng hề ở dưới luật pháp (Galatians 5:16-18).`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Có một vấn đề trong bản dịch tiếng Việt 1934 khiến ý nghĩa của câu 16 không được chính xác, mà còn có thể gây nhiều trở ngại trong đời sống đức tin. Xin liệt kê vài bản dịch khác dưới đây:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tôi muốn nói rằng: Nếu anh chị em sống theo Thánh Linh thì sẽ không thi hành theo dục vọng xác thịt (VietNVB)
But I say, live by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh (NET)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chữ “and,” hoặc chữ “thì” trong bản VietNVB, được dịch ra từ chữ “καί” là một tiếp từ, conjunction, để nói lên điều sau là kết quả của điều trước. Ngoài ra bản dịch 1934 còn có một khuyết điểm lớn nữa là sự dùng chữ “chớ” để nhấn mạnh sự thi hành điều được viết ra sau đó, trái với ý nghĩa đúng của nó là kết quả của điều đi trước. Do đó bản dịch 1934 đặt trọng tâm vào sự thống trị xác thịt ngang hàng với sự bước theo Thánh Linh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong đoạn này Phao-lô chỉ cho chúng ta cách để KHÔNG thỏa mãn những đòi hỏi của xác thịt, hay nói cách khác là để đạt được sự đầu phục Chúa, bằng cách bước đi theo Thánh Linh thay vì chiến đấu với xác thịt vốn là phần không thể phục dưới luật pháp Đức Chúa Trời.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nhưng bước đi theo Thánh Linh nghĩa là gì? Cầu nguyện không ngừng? Trong trí óc đặt mình trong sự hiện diện của Chúa? Đọc Kinh thánh nhiều hơn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Động lực thúc đẩy một người ước muốn sự đầu phục đến từ đâu? Phải chăng vì sự chiến đấu không ngừng giữa điều ác người đó chán ghét nhưng cuối cùng lại sa vào đó vì tâm thần thì muốn nhưng xác thịt yếu đuối?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Còn một điều quan trọng nữa mà chúng ta thường không để ý trong câu 18: “Nhưng, ví bằng anh em nhờ Thánh Linh chỉ dẫn, thì chẳng hề ở dưới luật pháp.” Luật pháp làm tăng cường độ của sự chiến đấu với xác thịt, như được viết trong 1 Corinthians 15:56 rằng: “sức mạnh của tội lỗi là luật pháp.” Khi một người sống dưới luật pháp, người đó có nhu cầu phải chế ngự xác thịt, để bắt nó phải phục, phải làm một điều nó không thể làm được: đó là phục dưới luật pháp Đức Chúa Trời. Câu 18 cho chúng ta thấy chính luật pháp là động cơ thúc đẩy cuộc xung đột đó, nhưng nhờ bước đi trong Thánh Linh chúng ta được thoát khỏi sự thống trị của luật pháp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đến đây chúng ta phải tự hỏi Đức Thánh Linh đóng vai trò gì trong mối liên hệ với Đức Chúa Trời? Chúa Giê-su diễn tả vai trò của Đức Thánh Linh như sau:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Khi Ngài đến thì sẽ khiến thế gian tự cáo về tội lỗi, về sự công bình và về sự phán xét. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Về tội lỗi, vì họ không tin ta (John 16:8-9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúa Giê-su giúp chúng ta dễ hiểu ý nghĩa thực của tội lỗi, của điều ngăn cách chúng ta với Đức Chúa Trời. Do đó trong sự giải thích vai trò của Đức Thánh Linh, Chúa Giê-su cho chúng ta thấy tội lỗi là sự chẳng đặt niềm tin nơi Ngài; khi một người đặt niềm tin nơi Đấng Christ, tội lỗi không còn là một vấn đề nữa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khi một người bước đi theo luật mới của Đức Chúa Trời: luật của Thánh Linh sự sống, nói rằng ai tin nơi Con Đức Chúa Trời thì có sự sống đời đời (John 3:36), người đó được thoát khỏi sự chiến đấu không ngừng để được kinh nghiệm sự yên nghỉ, hoặc đầu phục, mà không cần nỗ lực, như một trẻ thơ an nghỉ trong lòng mẹ. Đó là cách chúng ta bước đi theo Thánh Linh. Đó là cách chúng ta đến sự đầu phục; chẳng phải qua sự chiến đấu với thịt và huyết (Ephesians 6:12), nhưng bởi đức tin, bởi sự đặt niềm tin trong việc mà Đấng Christ đã làm trọn trên thập tự giá.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sự tìm cách đầu phục qua nỗ lực của xác thịt là một tiến trình không ngừng nghỉ nhưng sẽ không bao giờ đưa chúng ta đến chỗ thực sự đầu phục Chúa, nhưng bước đi theo Thánh Linh là một việc làm một lần đủ cả khi chúng ta đặt niềm tin nơi Đấng Christ: Mọi sự đã được trọn! Nếu thế gian đã sai lầm về ý nghĩa của tội lỗi, thì họ cũng sai lầm về nỗ lực của họ để đầu phục. Vì tội lỗi không đến từ những sự vấp phạm, nhưng đến từ sự không đặt niềm tin nơi Đấng Christ, sự đầu phục cũng vậy, nó không phải đặt nền tảng trên sự tìm cách để bắt xác thịt mình phải phục, nhưng ở chỗ yên nghỉ nơi việc Đấng Christ đã làm trọn. Một bên là sự dâng của lễ thiêu đền tội cứ lập đi lập lại hằng năm, còn một bên là sự dâng một lần đủ cả bởi Đấng đến từ Đức Chúa Trời.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

This article is a twin sibbling of the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/bible-topics/meditations/put-to-death-the-deeds-of-the-body/&quot;&gt;Mortify the deeds of the flesh&lt;/a&gt;&quot; article, it sets up the proper foundation for understanding the concept of sin presented here. Of all the key concepts that Martin Luther demanded that readers of Scriptures should grasp, &quot;sin&quot; is perhaps the most important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? (Romans 6:1—NET)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day a friend shared something his young son asked upon reading a passage from a study bible. The study bible has a note that explains the meaning of “repentance.” It explains that repentance is a turning a way from sin and turn back to God. He saw a quiet concern in his son’s face. The boy knew the impossibility of achieving this repentance in all its full meaning. He’s more honest than many adults who might have read it without giving it much further thought for many reasons; maybe it’s nothing to worry about, maybe they think they have successfully turned away from sins, they sense no reason for distress even if this definition of repentance might turn out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy’s understanding of “sin” is representative of virtually every practicing Christian including one hundred percent of Bible commentaries I’ve surveyed on this topic. These commentators, who very likely reflect the Church’s understanding of the concept of sin, assume that the “sin” in Romans 6:1 is limited to a pattern of sin of certain degree of severity such as those spelled out in the Ten Commandments or others; therefore in this sense they can freely count themselves as not among the guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These men, the commentators, missed the very basic point of theology that even if they never commit any transgressions known to man, they are “in sin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mankind-is-always-in-sin&quot;&gt;Mankind is always in sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam (who is a type of the coming one) transgressed (Romans 5:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Romans 5:14, the apostle Paul established the sinful condition of man: they cannot escape being in sin no matter how hard they try. The sinful condition is not from the sins that they committed or must repent from, it’s the body of death (Romans 7:24) that is inseparable from them until Christ comes again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is in fact man is perpetually in sin and it is impossible for them to get out of of such state, then why did Paul write in Romans 6:1 that they should not remain in sin? Do you see the contradiction? On the one hand they cannot escape sin, and on the other hand they must not remain in sin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, such contradiction does indeed exist if one holds the view of sin like the boy as told earlier, or those of the well known Bible commentators. But for so long, Christians accept and live with such contradiction. The boy in our story knew better. He could feel there was something wrong in the study bible note that appeared to be as authoritative as the word of God itself. He saw the contradiction and it put him in distress. As a boy, he saw sin for what it was, no embellishment, no denial, no attempt to cover up with pious platitude. But most of us Christians are like the Pharisees, we see the specks in others but not the logs in our own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sacrifices&quot;&gt;The sacrifices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mankind, the religious people, have always related to God through sin. To deal with sins they offered sacrifices, perform religious rituals, acts of penances, or whatever their religious beliefs dictate. The Jews of the Old Covenant had their own prescribed way to get relief for sins. The Christians of the New Covenant also came up with ways to deal with sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a perpetual cycle of sin and relief. They could see no other way to relate to God. It is sin that stands between them and their gods. Yet they could not get rid of it completely. Paul wrote these verses in Hebrews that beautifully express the dilemma of those who relate to God through their sin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;completely unable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;perfect those who come to worship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;no further consciousness of sin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year (Hebrews 10:1-3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the law is “completely unable” to make the believers perfect, sin is everpresent between them and God; as a matter of fact, the sacrifices instead of fully erasing sin, they serve as “reminders” of it. It’s obvious in Paul’s writing that the ultimate goal of the believers is to have “no further consciousness of sin.” But nothing has enabled them to achieve this thus far. As long as there is the consciousness of sin in their minds, they cannot draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Christians mistakenly use 1 John 1:9 as means to eradicate sins, as if their confessions can be used to replace the Old Covenant sacrifices to be repeated over and over again. But even those sacrifices could neither get rid of their sins nor their guilt; the only thing that can accomplish such thing is the blood of Christ. The confession in 1 John 1:8-10 is a confession of faith, of their sinful condition and acknowledging Christ as Savior; it has nothing to do with sin and guilt offering under the Old Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore under the Old Covenant system of sacrifices, or modern versions of penances, man “remain in sin” because the “consciousness of sin” remain in their minds and hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cross&quot;&gt;The cross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently in Romans 6:6-7, Paul explained how we can be set free from sin’s dominion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;We know that our &lt;u&gt;old man was crucified with him&lt;/u&gt; so that the body of sin would &lt;u&gt;no longer dominate us&lt;/u&gt;, so that we would &lt;u&gt;no longer be enslaved to sin&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;(For someone who has died has been freed from sin) (Romans 6:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to these verses, how were we freed from sin? Through “turning away from sin” like the note on repentance of the study bible? Through the natural view of sin in the eyes of a child? And the various Bible commentators? None of the above. Romans 6:6 says that it is through our old man being crucified with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slave cannot overcome his master, but must be set free. It’s the same way with our slavery to sin, we cannot wiggle ourselves out of it, no matter how much determination or will power one may possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore though we did not physically get crucified, we inherit Christ’s crucifixion on the virtue of our faith in Him. It’s the same way we receive this gift of being set free from sin, or our no longer “remain in sin”, all thanks to what Christ had accomplished on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as we still live in our body of flesh, we’ll never be completely free from sin, but our position in Christ has changed, our relationship with God has changed. It has changed from being condemned sinners to being children of God. Though the capacity for sinning is still there with us, we no longer relate to God through sin, but through the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God gives us permission to lead a guilt-free life in our relationship with Him, in our salvation and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.  2 For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:1-2).&lt;br /&gt;
As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us (Psalms 103:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the apostle Paul wrote these great verses in Romans. To remind them that they had been set free from sin, and they don’t have to remain in the mindset, or the outlook, of being condemned sinners anymore. Now do we know what he really meant? He didn’t mean at all to ask why you still fall into this sin or that sin, but he meant why are you still walking scared like sin still has the power to put you under condemnation, why you still try to pay the ransom though it has already been paid for? Just like soldiers who came back from a long drawn out war still live with terrible memories. They came back to the free world but in their minds they’re still captives. So it is with many Christians who still came back to the place where they offered sacrifices for their sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to remain in sin. Christ has set you free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy chúng ta sẽ nói làm sao? Chúng ta phải cứ ở trong tội lỗi, hầu cho ân điển được dư dật chăng?  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Chẳng hề như vậy! Chúng ta đã chết về tội lỗi, lẽ nào còn sống trong tội lỗi nữa? (Romans&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgba(0,0,0,0);&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;6:1—NET)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther khẳng định rằng: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #8e4503;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Trước hết, chúng ta phải quen thuộc với cách dùng chữ trong thơ Rô-ma và biết ý của Phao-lô khi ông dùng những chữ như luật pháp, tội lỗi, ân điển, đức tin, công bình, xác thịt, thần linh, v.v. Vì nếu không thì có đọc cũng vô ích. … Bạn không thể hiểu chữ luật pháp theo cách thường của loài người, chẳng hạn như lề luật về những điều cần làm hoặc những điều bị ngăn cấm.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Chữ “tội lỗi” trong bối cảnh của Rô-ma là chữ bị hiểu lầm nhiều nhất.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;li-m-u&quot;&gt;Lời mở đầu&lt;/h2&gt;

Bài viết này đi song song với bài &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/hoc-kinh-thanh/suy-gam/lam-cho-chet-cac-viec-cua-chi-the/&quot;&gt;Làm Chết Các Việc Của Chi Thể&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, bài đó thiết lập một nền tảng đúng đắn để chúng ta có thể hiểu ý nghĩa thực sự của tội lỗi sẽ được trình bày trong bài viết này. Trong các điểm chính mà Martin Luther đòi hỏi người đọc Kinh Thánh phải nắm vững, có lẽ &quot;tội lỗi&quot; là điều quan trọng nhất.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy chúng ta sẽ nói làm sao? Chúng ta phải cứ ở trong tội lỗi, hầu cho ân điển được dư dật chăng?  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Chẳng hề như vậy! Chúng ta đã chết về tội lỗi, lẽ nào còn sống trong tội lỗi nữa? (Romans 6:1—NET)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Có một hôm một người bạn nói với tôi về câu hỏi của đứa con trai tuổi độ mười hai, cậu bé nêu lên một thắc mắc sau khi đọc một đoạn Kinh Thánh trong một bản dịch Kinh Thánh có phụ chú. Bản Kinh Thánh này có một phần ghi chú về ý nghĩa của chữ “ăn năn.” Đoạn phụ chú đó giải thích rằng “ăn năn nghĩa là từ bỏ tội lỗi và trở về với Chúa.” Người bạn tôi thấy một nỗi lo lắng trên khuôn mặt con mình. Cậu bé biết nếu đó thực sự là ý nghĩa của sự ăn năn thì quả thực là một điều không thể thực hiện được. Nó còn thành thật hơn nhiều kẻ trưởng thành có thể đã được đọc hoặc nghe định nghĩa đó mà chẳng suy nghĩ gì sâu xa hơn vì nhiều lý do khác nhau; có lẽ họ thấy chẳng có gì phải lo, có lẽ họ nghĩ họ đã thành công trong sự lìa bỏ tội lỗi, họ không cảm thấy sự cấp bách dù trong lòng họ có tin vào định nghĩa của sự ăn năn đó.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ý niệm của cậu bé về “tội lỗi” là điển hình của hầu hết các tín hữu và toàn bộ một trăm phần trăm những sách giải kinh mà tôi đã tham khảo khi viết bài này. Những nhà giải kinh này, có lẽ họ phản ảnh sự hiểu biết của hội thánh về tội lỗi, giả định rằng “tội lỗi” trong Romans 6:1 chỉ giới hạn trong những sự vi phạm ở một mức độ trầm trọng nào đó như những điều được ghi xuống trong Mười Điều Răn hoặc các luật khác; vì thế trong khía cạnh đó họ có thể tự do kể như mình không thuộc về hàng ngũ của những kẻ ở trong tội lỗi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Những người này, những nhà giải kinh, đã không hiểu điểm rất căn bản của thần học rằng cho dù họ có không bao giờ phạm đến một tội mà người ta thường phạm trong thế gian, họ cũng vẫn bị “ở trong tội lỗi.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nhn-loi-lun--trong-ti-li&quot;&gt;Nhân loại luôn ở trong tội lỗi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nhưng từ A-đam cho đến Môi-se, sự chết đã cai trị cả đến những kẻ chẳng phạm tội giống như tội của A-đam, là người làm hình bóng của Ðấng phải đến. (Romans 5:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong Romans 5:14, sứ đồ Phao-lô đã thiết lập nền tảng của tình trạng tội lỗi của nhân loại: họ không thể nào thoát khỏi sự ở trong tội lỗi dù có cố gắng thế nào đi chăng nữa. Tình trạng tội lỗi không đến từ những điều họ làm hoặc hoặc phải lìa bỏ, nhưng đến từ “thân thể hay chết” (Romans 7:24) dính chặt vào con người của họ cho đến ngày của Đấng Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nếu quả thực nhân loại luôn ở trong tội lỗi và họ không thể nào thoát ra khỏi tình trạng đó, thì tại sao Phao-lô lại viết trong Romans 6:1 rằng họ đừng ở trong tội lỗi nữa? Các bạn có thấy sự mâu thuẫn đó không? Một đàng họ không thể nào thoát khỏi tội lỗi, còn một đàng khác họ không được ở trong tội lỗi nữa?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thực vậy, sự mâu thuẫn đó thực sự hiện hữu nếu chúng ta mang sự hiểu biết về tội lỗi và ăn năn giống như cậu bé ở trên, hoặc như những nhà giải kinh nổi tiếng nhiều người biết đến. Nhưng đã từ lâu lắm rồi, người tín hữu chấp nhận và sống trong sự mâu thuẫn đó. Cậu bé trong câu chuyện ở trên biết rõ điều này hơn rất nhiều người già giặn hơn cậu. Cậu cảm thấy có một vấn đề trong phần phụ chú của cuốn Thánh Kinh đó, phần phụ chú mà người ta thường nghĩ chính là lời Chúa. Cậu bé thấy sự mâu thuẫn khiến cậu lo lắng. Là một đứa trẻ, cậu nhìn tội lỗi theo chính bản chất của nó, không thêu dệt, không tự dối mình, không phủ lấp với bề ngoài có vẻ thiêng liêng. Nhưng đa số chúng ta giống như người Pha-ri-si, chỉ thấy dằm trong mắt người khác mà không thấy đà trong mắt mình.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nhng-ca-t-l&quot;&gt;Những của tế lễ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nhân loại, những người có tín ngưỡng, luôn luôn liên hệ với Thượng Đế qua tội lỗi. Để giải quyết vấn đề tội lỗi, họ dâng những của lễ, cử hành những nghi lễ, bày tỏ những hành động ăn năn, hoặc bất cứ điều gì tín lý của họ đòi hỏi. Người Do Thái dưới Cựu Ước có phương cách riêng của họ để làm vơi đi gánh nặng của tội lỗi. Người tín hữu trong Tân Ước cũng dùng những phương cách riêng để giải quyết vấn đề tội lỗi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đó là một chuỗi liên tục của tội lỗi và sự an nghỉ tạm. Họ không thấy một cách nào khác để liên hệ với Chúa. Tội lỗi luôn luôn ngăn cách họ với các thần của họ. Nhưng họ không thể nào loại bỏ được sự ngăn cách đó cách trọn vẹn. Phao-lô viết những lời này trong sách Hê-bơ-rơ bày tỏ một cách sâu sắc nan đề của những kẻ liên hệ với Chúa qua tội lỗi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Vả, luật pháp chỉ là bóng của sự tốt lành ngày sau, không có hình thật của các vật, nên &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;không bao giờ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; cậy tế lễ mỗi năm hằng dâng như vậy, mà &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;khiến kẻ đến gần Ðức Chúa Trời trở nên trọn lành được&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Nếu được, thì những kẻ thờ phượng đã một lần được sạch rồi, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;lương tâm họ không còn biết tội nữa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, nhơn đó, há chẳng thôi dâng tế lễ hay sao?  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Trái lại, những tế lễ đó chẳng qua là mỗi năm nhắc cho nhớ lại tội lỗi. (Hebrews 10:1-3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vì luật pháp “không bao giờ,” hoặc “hoàn toàn không thể” nếu dựa trên một trong những bản dịch Anh ngữ, làm cho người tín hữu được trọn vẹn, do đó tội lỗi luôn luôn là khoảng ngăn cách giữa họ và Đức Chúa Trời; thực ra các của lễ, thay vì hoàn toàn tẩy sạch tội lỗi họ, lại “nhắc nhở” họ về vấn đề tội lỗi càng hơn. Chúng ta thấy rõ trong bài viết của Phao-lô rằng mục đích tối hậu của người tín hữu là “lương tâm họ không còn biết tội lỗi nữa.” Nhưng cho đến nay không điều gì có thể giúp họ đạt được mục đích đó. Khi nào tâm trí họ còn mang mặc cảm tội lỗi thì họ không thể nào đến gần Đức Chúa Trời.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Những tín hữu thời nay thường lầm lẫn khi dùng 1 John 1:9 như phương tiện để tẩy sạch tội lỗi, như thể lời xưng nhận của họ có hiệu quả thay thể những của lễ của Cựu Ước được lập đi lập lại thường xuyên. Nhưng đoạn Kinh Thánh trên cho biết những của lễ đó không tẩy sạch lương tâm họ khỏi tội lỗi; ngoại trừ  điều duy nhất có thể đạt được mục đích là dòng huyết của Đấng Christ. Sự xưng nhận trong 1 John 1:9 là sự xưng nhận đức tin, về tình trạng tội lỗi của họ và nhìn nhận Chúa Giê-su là Cứu Chúa; chúng chẳng cùng một mục đích với những của lễ chuộc tội của thời Cựu Ước.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do đó dưới hệ thống dâng của lễ của thời Cựu Ước, cũng như cung cách ăn năn sám hối của thời nay, nhân loại vẫn “ở trong tội lỗi” vì “mặc cảm tội lỗi” vẫn còn trong tâm trí họ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thp-t-gi&quot;&gt;Thập tự giá&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiếp theo đó trong Romans 6:6-7, Phao-lô giải thích bằng cách nào chúng ta có thể được thoát khỏi sự thống trị của tội lỗi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;vì biết rõ rằng người cũ của chúng ta đã bị đóng đinh trên thập tự giá với Ngài, hầu cho thân thể của tội lỗi bị tiêu diệt đi, và chúng ta không phục dưới tội lỗi nữa.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Vì ai đã chết thì được thoát khỏi tội lỗi (Romans 6:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theo những câu Kinh Thánh này, làm sao chúng ta thoát được sự thống trị của tội lỗi? Bằng cách “ngoảnh xa khỏi tội lỗi” như định nghĩa về ăn năn trong quyển Kinh Thánh Study Bible? Qua cái nhìn dựa trên xác thịt như của trẻ thơ? Và muôn vàn nhãn quan của các nhà giải kinh? Tất cả đều sai. Vì Romans 6:6 cho biết rằng chúng ta thoát được là nhờ con người cũ đã chịu đóng đinh cùng Đấng Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Một kẻ nô lệ không thể nào thắng hơn được chủ, nhưng phải được giải thoát. Sự nô lệ dưới tội lỗi cũng vậy, chúng ta không thể nào dẫy dụa mong tìm đường thoát, dù có kiên cường hay ý chí đến đâu chăng nữa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do đó mặc dầu chúng ta không thực sự chịu đóng đinh trong thể xác, chúng ta được thừa hưởng sự đóng đinh của Chúa Giê-su chỉ nhờ đặt đức tin nơi Ngài. Đó cũng là cách chúng ta nhận được sự giải thoát khỏi tội lỗi, hoặc là sự “không còn ở trong tội lỗi,” tất cả chỉ vì điều Chúa Giê-su đã hoàn tất trên thập tự giá.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ngày nào chúng ta còn sống trong thân xác này, chúng ta sẽ không bao giờ hoàn toàn thoát khỏi tội lỗi, nhưng địa vị chúng ta trong Đấng Christ đã thay đổi, mối liên hệ chúng ta với Đức Chúa Trời đã thay đổi. Thay đổi từ địa vị tội nhân bị nguyền rủa sang sự được làm con cái Đức Chúa Trời. Mặc dầu khả năng phạm tội vẫn còn đó, chúng ta không còn liên hệ với Đức Chúa Trời qua tội lỗi nữa, nhưng qua thập tự giá.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúa cho chúng ta được phép sống một đời sống không mang mặc cảm tội lỗi nữa trong mối liên hệ với Ngài, trong sự cứu rỗi và sự sống đời đời.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you[a] free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:1-2).&lt;br /&gt;
As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us (Psalms 103:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kt-lun&quot;&gt;Kết luận&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đó là lý do sứ đồ Phao-lô viết những đoạn Kinh Thánh kỳ diệu này trong sách Rô-ma. Để nhắc nhở họ rằng họ đã được thoát khỏi tội lỗi, và không còn phải ở trong tâm trạng, hoặc trong nhãn quan, của kẻ tội nhân bị nguyền rủa nữa. Vậy chúng ta có hiểu ý của Phao-lô chưa? Ông không có ý chút nào để hỏi tại sao chúng ta vẫn còn phạm tội này tội kia, nhưng ông hỏi tại sao chúng ta vẫn còn bước đi trong sự sợ hãi như thể tội lỗi vẫn còn quyền lực đặt chúng ta dưới sự rủa xả, tại sao chúng ta vẫn còn tìm cách dâng của lễ chuộc tội khi mọi món nợ đã được trả? Cũng như những người chiến sĩ trở về sau một cuộc chiến tranh dài dằng dẵng mang theo những ký ức kinh hoàng. Họ trở về thế giới tự do nhưng sâu trong tâm khảm họ vẫn là kẻ sống trong tù ngục chiến tranh. Nhiều tín hữu cũng như thế, họ cứ quay trở về chỗ dâng những của tế lễ chuộc tội cho mình.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bạn không còn phải ở trong tội lỗi nữa. Chúa đã cho bạn được tự do rồi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-love-commandment&quot;&gt;The Love Commandment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/loving-God.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The love command that Jesus uttered in Luke 10:27 has become a golden rule for virtually all variations of Bible based religions.  All other teachings from the Bible take a back seat to yield to this venerable command especially that it came from the lips of the Savior. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;“What is written in the Law?&lt;/span&gt;” he replied. “&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;How do you read it?&lt;/span&gt;” &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ” &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;“&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;You have answered correctly&lt;/span&gt;,” Jesus replied. “&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;Do this and you will live&lt;/span&gt;” (Luke 10:25-28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus reminded his listeners of this command as it was recorded in Deuteronomy 6:5. Now He used it, He used the answer of the expert of the law, or perhaps what the man heard from Jesus in Matthew 22:37 to form his answer, to summarize the Ten Commandments which became even more powerful and encompassing than the original version as Moses received from mount Sinai. It penetrates deep into the heart and reveals sins no other commands can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chance-for-success&quot;&gt;Chance for success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the Ten Commandments to reflect on how mankind has measured up to this Old Covenant’s golden standard. The Ten Commandments are just a more concrete version of the law that was written in the conscience of our first parents in the Garden of Eden. Mankind with or without the Ten Commandments had failed to keep even a single point of the law, and this is not to even mention what is written in James 2:10: &lt;em&gt;“For the one who obeys the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.”&lt;/em&gt; Is there a living being that has never failed in at least one point of the law?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the new golden rule, the love command? Jesus is supposed to make it harder for the religious people of His time to prove their own righteousness through the golden rule. He wants His hearer to stop raising their fists saying &lt;em&gt;“We are willing to do all the words that the LORD has said (Exodus 24:3)”&lt;/em&gt; but instead be on their knees acknowledge their failure and place their trust in Him. If they could not keep the Ten Commandments, what chance do they have of keeping the love command?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus used the love command to point out sin in the hearts of those who did not physically commit adultery, or murder anyone. The old commandment says: &lt;em&gt;“Thou shalt not commit murder,”&lt;/em&gt; the new commandment says: &lt;em&gt;“You must not commit murder in your heart.”&lt;/em&gt; The old commandment says: &lt;em&gt;“Thou shalt not commit adultery,”&lt;/em&gt; the new commandment says “You must not commit adultery in your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the love commandment is not the golden rule, it’s the new death sentence to all who try to get righteousness through it. The chance for success is not slim, but none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-nature-of-man&quot;&gt;The nature of Man&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins (Ecclesiastes 7:20)&lt;br /&gt;
If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us (1 John 1:8)&lt;br /&gt;
The human mind is more deceitful than anything else. It is incurably bad. Who can understand it? (Jeremiah 17:9)&lt;br /&gt;
It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners (Mark 2:17)&lt;br /&gt;
For from within the hearts of men come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery (Mark 7:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any chance man in such fallen condition can fulfill the love command? From the heart and mind that is “more deceitful than anything else?” But Jesus knew this already. He gave the command to stop man from deceiving himself, to get them off their pedestal, to realize that they are “wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked (Revelation 3:17).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-honesty-of-peter&quot;&gt;The honesty of Peter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;Then when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  me more than these do?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; you.” Jesus told him, “Feed my lambs.” &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; me?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; you.” Jesus told him, “Shepherd my sheep.” &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; me?” Peter was distressed that Jesus asked him a third time, “Do you &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; me?” and said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; you.” Jesus replied, “Feed my sheep.” (John 21:15-17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the words “love” in the passage above, one in bold and one in bold red. The one in bold red. The word &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in bold red has the Strong number 25 for the Greek word &lt;strong&gt;ἀγαπάω&lt;/strong&gt;, or agapáō, the same word that is used in the love commandment, while the word &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; in bold black has the Strong number 5368 for the Greek word &lt;strong&gt;φιλέω&lt;/strong&gt;, or philéō, denoting a fondness between friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus asked Peter for the third time whether he loved him, He came down to Peter’s level and used the word “philéō” instead. Peter never once used the word for “agapáō.” As gung-ho as anyone could be, Peter refused to commit to ἀγαπάω, or agapáō.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-love&quot;&gt;What is love?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way Jesus asked Peter for the first two times whether he &lt;strong&gt;ἀγαπάω&lt;/strong&gt;, or agapáō, him, is the same way He gave mankind the love commandment, to humble them, to make them realize that they’re mere man hence incapable of loving God with all their hearts, minds, and souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So God wrote in 1 John 4:10 to settle it once for all that love is not about man loving God, but it’s about God who is compassionate and merciful toward man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins (1 John 4:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s God who loves the world, and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man inherently cannot love God. They think they can but in fact they love themselves. In saying they love God they elevate themselves to a higher level than they really are. They &lt;strong&gt;φιλέω&lt;/strong&gt;, or philéō, God but mistakenly think that they can &lt;strong&gt;ἀγαπάω&lt;/strong&gt;, or agapáō, Him. To fulfill the love commandment is to agapáō God, which is humanly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta hãy suy gẫm về hai câu Kinh Thánh sau: &lt;em&gt;“Ngươi phải hết lòng, hết linh hồn, hết sức, hết trí mà kính mến Chúa là Ðức Chúa Trời ngươi”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Luke&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgba(0,0,0,0);&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;10:27)&lt;/em&gt;, và &lt;em&gt;“Nầy sự yêu thương ở tại đây: ấy chẳng phải chúng ta đã yêu Ðức Chúa Trời, nhưng Ngài đã yêu chúng ta, và sai Con Ngài làm của lễ chuộc tội chúng ta” (1 John&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgba(0,0,0,0);&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;4:10)&lt;/em&gt;. Làm sao chúng ta có thể hoà giải được hai chân lý này về sự yêu thương? Một mệnh lệnh chúng ta phải yêu Chúa cách hết lòng, còn một định nghĩa khác nói rằng tình yêu không phải là của loài người cho Chúa, nhưng là của Chúa yêu loài người.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mnh-lnh-yu-thng&quot;&gt;Mệnh Lệnh Yêu Thương&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/loving-God.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Mệnh lệnh yêu thương mà Chúa Giê-su đã phán trong Luke 10:27 đã trở nên một khuôn vàng thước ngọc cho hầu hết các giáo phái đặt nền tảng trên Thánh Kinh. Tất cả các sự dạy dỗ khác trong Kinh Thánh đều phải lùi lại để nhường chỗ cho mệnh lệnh cao cả này nhất là khi nó đến từ miệng của Đấng Cứu Thế.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Bấy giờ, một thầy dạy luật đứng dậy hỏi đặng thử Ðức Chúa Jêsus rằng: Thưa thầy, tôi phải làm gì để được hưởng sự sống đời đời?  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Ngài phán rằng: Trong luật pháp có chép điều gì? Ngươi đọc gì trong đó?  &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Thưa rằng: Ngươi phải hết lòng, hết linh hồn, hết sức, hết trí mà kính mến Chúa là Ðức Chúa Trời ngươi; và yêu người lân cận như mình.  &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Chúa Jêsus phán rằng: Ngươi đáp phải lắm; hãy làm điều đó, thì được sống (Luke 10:25-28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúa Giê-su nhắc nhở người nghe về mệnh lệnh này đã được ghi trong sách Phục Truyền Luật Lệ Ký 6:5. Bây giờ Ngài dùng nó, Ngài dùng chính câu trả lời của một sành sõi luật pháp Môi-se, hay có lẽ đây là lời mà chính người đó đã nghe Chúa phán trong Matthew 22:37, để tóm lại ý nghĩa của Mười Điều Răn, mà còn làm cho ý nghĩa của nó mạnh mẽ hơn và gói ghém trọn vẹn hơn bản văn nguyên thuỷ khi Môi-se nhận từ trên đỉnh núi Si-nai. Lời đó đâm thấu vào lòng người và phơi bày tội lỗi hơn bất cứ mệnh lệnh nào khác.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lm-trn-c-iu-rn&quot;&gt;Làm trọn được điều răn?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta hãy trở về với Mười Điều Răn để suy gẫm xem nhân loại đã đạt được đến mức nào để thoả mãn được tiêu chuẩn tối cao này dưới Cựu Ước. Mười Điều Răn chỉ là sự thể hiện rõ ràng hơn của luật pháp đã được ghi vào tâm khảm của tổ tiên chúng ta trong vườn Địa Đàng. Loài người dù có Mười Điều Răn hay có những luật từ lương tâm (Romans 2:14), chẳng một ai giữ được dù chỉ một điều thôi, đó là chưa nói tới đoạn Kinh Thánh trong James 2:10 viết như sau: &lt;em&gt;“Vì người nào giữ trọn luật pháp, mà phạm một điều răn, thì cũng đáng tội như đã phạm hết thảy.”&lt;/em&gt; Có ai trong nhân loại không hề phạm tội dù chỉ một điều?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thế còn khuôn vàng thước ngọc, mệnh lệnh yêu thương? Mục đích của Chúa Giê-su là Ngài dùng tiêu chuẩn tối cao đó để những người thời đó nhận thức rằng họ không thể nào đạt được sự công bình qua những việc đạo đức của mình. Ngài muốn họ đừng giơ tay tuyên bố điều mà họ không làm được:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;Môi-se bèn đến thuật lại cho dân sự mọi lời phán của Ðức Giê-hô-va và các luật lệ, thì chúng đồng thinh đáp rằng: &lt;strong&gt;Chúng tôi sẽ làm mọi lời Ðức Giê-hô-va phán dạy&lt;/strong&gt; (Exodus 24:1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nhưng thay vì thế họ nên quỳ gối nhìn nhận sự bất lực của mình mà đặt niềm tin nơi Ngài. Nếu họ không giữ được Mười Điều Răn, thì làm sao họ giữ được mệnh lệnh yêu thương?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúa Giê-su đã dùng mệnh lệnh yêu thương để vạch ra tội lỗi trong lòng những người dù không thực sự phạm tội ngoại tình trong thể xác, hoặc giết hại một ai. Mệnh lệnh trong Cựu Ước viết rằng: &lt;em&gt;“Chớ giết người,”&lt;/em&gt; thì mệnh lệnh trong Tân Ước viết: &lt;em&gt;“Chớ mang ý tưởng muốn giết người.”&lt;/em&gt; Mệnh lệnh cũ viết: &lt;em&gt;“Chớ phạm tội tà dâm,”&lt;/em&gt; thì mệnh lệnh mới viết: &lt;em&gt;“Chớ động lòng tà dâm.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thật vậy, mệnh lệnh yêu thương không phải là một khuôn vàng thước ngọc, mà là một bản án tử hình mới cho bất cứ ai tìm cách dùng nó để đạt được sự công bình. Thật chẳng ai có thể đạt được điều đó.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bn-cht-loi-ngi&quot;&gt;Bản chất loài người&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vì mọi người đều phạm tội và thiếu mất sự vinh hiển của Đức Chúa Trời ((Romans 3:23).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thật, chẳng có người công bình ở trên đất làm điều thiện, mà không hề phạm tội (Ecclesiastes 7:20).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ví bằng chúng ta nói mình không có tội chi hết, ấy là chính chúng ta lừa dối mình, và lẽ thật không ở trong chúng ta (1 John 1:8).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lòng người ta là dối trá hơn mọi vật, và rất là xấu xa: ai có thể biết được? (Jeremiah 17:9)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ðức Chúa Jêsus nghe vậy, bèn phán cùng họ rằng: Chẳng phải kẻ mạnh khỏe cần thầy thuốc đâu, nhưng là kẻ có bịnh; ta chẳng phải đến gọi người công bình, nhưng gọi kẻ có tội (Mark 2:17).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vì thật là tự trong lòng người mà ra những ác tưởng, sự dâm dục, trộm cướp, giết người (Mark 7:21).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Có thể nào một người trong tình trạng kể trên lại làm trọn được mệnh lệnh yêu thương? Từ tấm lòng và tâm trí “dối trá hơn mọi vật?” Nhưng Chúa Giê-su đã biết điều này rồi. Ngài ban mệnh lệnh đó để loài người đừng tự dối mình nữa, để họ bước xuống khỏi bệ cao và nhận thức rằng họ là những người “khổ sở, khốn khó, nghèo ngặt, đui mù và lỏa lồ (Revelation 3:17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;s-thnh-tht-ca-phi-e-r&quot;&gt;Sự thành thật của Phi-e-rơ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;Khi ăn rồi, Ðức Chúa Jêsus phán cùng Si-môn Phi -e-rơ rằng: Hỡi Si-môn, con Giô-na, ngươi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;yêu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ta hơn những kẻ nầy chăng? Phi -e-rơ thưa rằng: Lạy Chúa, phải, Chúa biết rằng tôi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;yêu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Chúa. Ðức Chúa Jêsus phán rằng: Hãy chăn những chiên con ta.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Ngài lại phán lần thứ hai cùng người rằng: Hỡi Si-môn, con Giô-na, ngươi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;yêu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ta chăng? Phi -e-rơ thưa rằng: Lạy Chúa, phải, Chúa biết rằng tôi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;yêu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Chúa. Ðức Chúa Jêsus phán rằng: Hãy chăn chiên ta.  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Ngài phán cùng người đến lần thứ ba rằng: Hỡi Si-môn, con Giô-na, ngươi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;yêu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ta chăng? Phi -e-rơ buồn rầu vì Ngài phán cùng mình đến ba lần: Ngươi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;yêu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ta chăng: Người bèn thưa rằng: Lạy Chúa, Chúa biết hết mọi việc; Chúa biết rằng tôi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;yêu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Chúa! Ðức Chúa Trời phán rằng: Hãy chăn chiên ta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chúng ta hãy chú ý đến chữ “yêu” trong đoạn Kinh thánh trên, một chữ đậm đen và một chữ đậm đỏ. Chữ &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;yêu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; màu đỏ đậm được mang số Strong 25 cho chữ Hy-lạp &lt;strong&gt;ἀγαπάω&lt;/strong&gt;, hoặc &lt;strong&gt;agapáō&lt;/strong&gt;, cùng một chữ được dùng trong mệnh lệnh yêu thương, trong khi chữ &lt;strong&gt;yêu&lt;/strong&gt; màu đậm đen mang số Strong 5368 cho chữ Hy-lạp &lt;strong&gt;φιλέω&lt;/strong&gt;, hoặc &lt;strong&gt;philéō&lt;/strong&gt;, nói lên sự yêu mến trong tình bạn hữu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khi Chúa Giê-su hỏi Phi-e-rơ lần thứ ba rằng ông có yêu Ngài không, Chúa đã hạ mình xuống ngang hàng với Phi-e-rơ và thay vào đó dùng chữ “philéō”. Trong suốt mẩu đối thoại đó Phi-e-rơ đã chẳng hề dùng chữ “agapáō.” Dù là một người ngông nghênh chẳng kém ai, Phi-e-rơ nhất định không chịu dùng chữ ἀγαπάω, hoặc agapáō.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nh-ngha-tnh-yu&quot;&gt;Định nghĩa tình yêu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cách Chúa Giê-su hỏi Phi-e-rơ hai lần đầu rằng ông có &lt;strong&gt;ἀγαπάω&lt;/strong&gt;, hoặc agapáō, Ngài, cũng là cách mà Ngài đã ban cho nhân loại mệnh lệnh yêu thương, để khiến họ hạ mình, nhận thức rằng họ chỉlà người phàm xác thịt không thể nào có khả năng yêu thương Đức Chúa Trời với hết tấm lòng, ý chí, và linh hồn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do đó Chúa đã viết trong 1 John 4:10 để xác định một lần cuối cùng rằng tình yêu không phải là của loài người dành cho Đức Chúa Trời, mà là của Đấng giàu lòng thương xót cho loài người.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nầy sự yêu thương ở tại đây: ấy chẳng phải chúng ta đã yêu Ðức Chúa Trời, nhưng Ngài đã yêu chúng ta, và sai Con Ngài làm của lễ chuộc tội chúng ta (1 John 4:10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Đó là chính Đức Chúa Trời đã yêu thương thế gian chứ chẳng phải họ yêu Ngài.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Vì Ðức Chúa Trời yêu thương thế gian, đến nỗi đã ban Con một của Ngài, hầu cho hễ ai tin Con ấy không bị hư mất mà được sự sống đời đời (John 3:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kt-lun&quot;&gt;Kết Luận&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vốn bản chất loài người không thể yêu thương Đức Chúa Trời. Họ nghĩ họ yêu Ngài nhưng thực ra họ yêu thương chính mình. Khi nói rằng họ yêu thương Đức Chúa Trời họ tự đặt mình lên địa vị cao hơn chính con người thực cuả họ. Họ &lt;strong&gt;φιλέω&lt;/strong&gt;, hoặc philéō, Đức Chúa Trời nhưng đã lầm tưởng rằng họ có thể &lt;strong&gt;ἀγαπάω&lt;/strong&gt;, hoặc agapáō, Ngài. Nếu muốn làm trọn mệnh lệnh yêu thương họ phải agapáō Chúa, nhưng đó là điều loài người không thể làm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of books have been written on the topic of serving God. Those who seem to be doing something in some ministries believe that they’re serving God. Those who write books on serving God believe that they served God. What about the rest of those who are at the receiving ends of the various teachings, how do they know what to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/serving-God.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
So how do you serve God? Just the word &quot;serve&quot; itself implies something to do with spiritual things, or something in service of others, something that demands selfless devotion, that requires a certain level of personal sacrifice.
When we talk about someone serving God, we imply that their act of service is something self initiated. It is initiated by self because it requires some personal sacrifice. Most biographies are about people who engaged in these noble acts of serving God at great personal cost. The implication also is these folks deserve some types of rewards for their sacrifices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- ##################### end FIRST PARAGRAPH ################### --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is this concept of serving God consistence with what the Bible writes about the work done toward the Kingdom of God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-biblical-meaning-of-serving-god&quot;&gt;The Biblical meaning of serving God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at Luke 17:7-10:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;“Would any one of you say to your slave who comes in from the field after plowing or shepherding sheep, ‘Come at once and sit down for a meal’? &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Won’t the master instead say to him, ‘Get my dinner ready, and make yourself ready to serve me while I eat and drink. Then you may eat and drink’? &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;He won’t thank the slave because he did what he was told, will he? &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;So you too, when you have done everything you were commanded to do, should say, ‘We are slaves undeserving of special praise; we have only done what was our duty.’” (Luke 17:7-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally we think of serving God as a voluntary and optional action. like serving a community by volunteering to work at a local food bank, or other non-profit organization. But here it appears the work involved is not the same, it’s neither voluntary nor optional, but it’s from a sense of duty, from a slave to his master. The work is expected of the slave. Therefore he’s not entitled to a reward, and of course not even a single praise. And since this work is required of the slave, it is not the same thing as a noble act of service we commonly refer to in church teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s study another example of service in the parable of the vineyard workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;And after agreeing with the workers for the standard wage, he sent them into his vineyard.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;When it was about nine o’clock in the morning, he went out again and saw others standing around in the marketplace without work.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and I will give you whatever is right.’  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;So they went. When he went out again about noon and three o’clock that afternoon, he did the same thing.  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;And about five o’clock that afternoon he went out and found others standing around, and said to them, ‘Why are you standing here all day without work?’  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go and work in the vineyard too.’  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and give the pay starting with the last hired until the first.’  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;When those hired about five o’clock came, each received a full day’s pay.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;And when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more. But each one also received the standard wage.  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;When they received it, they began to complain against the landowner,  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;saying, ‘These last fellows worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the hardship and burning heat of the day.’  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;And the landowner replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me to work for the standard wage?  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last man the same as I gave to you.  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;Am I not permitted to do what I want with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?’  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;So the last will be first, and the first last.” (Matthew 20:1-16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is the same Jesus who told this parable as the one who told the story in Luke 17, we must think of these works as the same type: work a slave performed for his master. The way the vineyard owner pays the workers shows a consistency in this master/slave relationship. Equal pays mean neither rewards or praises toward the slaves. It’s probably not even a salary, because if it were, it would have been proportional to the amount of work performed. Then what is this payment for if it is none of these: reward, or salary? It’s probably for what they need for food, clothing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to combine both these stories into one, the meaning of serving God might be like this: there is no voluntary or optional service—because of the slave/master relationship, but there is one assigned to each according to the will of the Lord, and since it’s is not voluntary, there is no reward, or praise, or even a salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little clarification is needed here. Though we now relate to God through Christ as sons and daughters, the meaning of service remains the same if grace is the foundation of all areas of the Christian life. In order for the work or service to be grace based, it can neither be voluntary nor optional, but it is something God has already prepared for each person according to the riches of His grace. This puts all who might be in the service of the King, or even those who might not appear to be in any kind of service, to be on an equal footing. God will assign each one according to his great wisdom. This also make irrelevant the exhortation to serve God, because if God pre-ordain, and “impose” the work on his slave—a figure of speech, what need is there for exhortation? Can you not do the work that God has pre-ordained for you? Could Moses, Jonah, or Paul resist the work that God had planned for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might we then venture to say that voluntary, self-initiated work is not accepted at all in the kingdom of God? The answer to this question is key to understanding service, or ministries, or anything done in the name of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-or-service-explained-through-grace&quot;&gt;Work, or service, explained through grace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us review the familiar passage of Ephesians 2:8-10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God;  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;it is not from works, so that no one can boast.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared beforehand so we may do them (Ephesians 2:8-10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often stop short at verse 9, but verse 10 gives is a definition of service that comes as a result of God’s grace. The good works are prepared ahead of time by God to those are called on the basis of His grace. As it is said earlier, in order for the works to be grace based, it can neither be voluntary nor optional, so therefore there will be neither reward nor praises. This takes a way all reason for boasting of personal piety. The “imposing” of pre-ordained work on a believer is actually an amazing act of God’s grace, because it takes away the confusion of trying to figure out what one must do to serve God, but instead it gives one the peace of mind to wait upon God until He revealed to them what they must do. No exhortation needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slave-to-righteousness&quot;&gt;Slave to righteousness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an amazing passage in Romans 6 where Paul used the imagery of slavery to show the transition from sin to righteousness which we may use to further explain that serving God is neither voluntary nor optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching you were entrusted to,  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;and having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness (Romans 6:17-18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the transition from slavery to sin to slavery to righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us talk about slavery to sin. Paul stated it as a matter of fact, that we were slaves to sin. In the slave/master relationship there is nothing optional, but everything is forcefully compelled upon the one at the receiving end, the slaves. Can a slave defy his master? No. Can a slave say to his master: Look, I’m serving you from the goodness of my heart, from my freedom to serve, not because I have to, but because I want to? No. Death will be the ultimate consequence if he does not do what is required of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul must have use the term “slavery” to show the irresistibility of good works that result from slavery to righteouness. Just as irresistible as sin is to the one enslaved to it, so is good works to the one who is enslaved to righteousness. We must understand that Paul is using this analogy to explain the irresistible power of grace in the lives of those who are in Christ to do good work. All this again removes the idea that good works done in the name of Christ are something initiated by self on a voluntary basis, where each person decides for himself what, where, when, and how to serve God. Absolutely not, the works are already prepared ahead of time by God from everlasting. No encouragement, nor any exhortation, needed. As a matter of fact, encouragement or exhortation from men may actually interfere or confuse the minds of the ones that God already had a plan for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul expressed this slave/master relationship in another way in Romans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do–this I keep on doing.” (Romans 7:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-question-of-free-will&quot;&gt;The question of free will&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone may raise the issue of free will, to counter the argument raised by this writing, that the service unto God must be volitional and self-initiated for it to have any value. At first glance this appears to be a proper motivation to serve God, to serve Him from the freedom of grace instead of the conditional requirement of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things get very interesting. At this point we can define not two, but three, types of service: one based on free will, one based on the requirement of a law, and one proposed by this article that it is predetermined and ordained by God ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service that almost everyone embraces here is one that is volitional and self-initiated, it appears to be most noble and seems to be in accordance with the principle of salvation by grace and through faith. But is such service, though volitional, pure in motivation? Isn’t there the slightest hint of desire for praise or rewards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one’s good work is completely free from even the slightest hint of selfish motivation. Jeremiah 17:9 says that the human heart is deceitful above all things. Isaiah spoke these words from God: &lt;em&gt;“All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away (Isaiah 64:6).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the only way for a service to count toward God’s kingdom is it must come from outside the person who performs the service so that rewards or praises on the basis of merit can be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God;  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;it is not from works, so that &lt;u&gt;no one can boast&lt;/u&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for &lt;u&gt;good works that God prepared beforehand&lt;/u&gt; so we may do them (Ephesians 2:8-10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romans 11:6 says that if any aspect of our relationship with God is by works then grace is no longer grace. Therefore boasting has no place in a grace-based relationship. No one works more than others because it is God who prepared the task for each person before hand. The “slave to righteousness (Romans 6:18)” concept though appears negative but it is the marvelous thing from the mind of God as part of the whole grace package. People are set free from the nagging question of whether they have done all they could to serve God. They rest in the all sufficiency of the Cross of Christ and trust that God already has a plan for each one to serve Him. In this sense, there is no need for “Serving God” as a topic for any book or sermon, except for one like this article which attempts to show that such topic is not needed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External motivation, through liturature of exhortation, urging the reader or listener concerning serving God, may cause someone to leave their current station in life thinking that it is not considered an act of service to God. Furthermore if God has already prepared a work in advance for someone, will He not reveal to them so they have to try to figure out His mind like superstitious people? The way God revealed His plan to Moses, Jonah, and Paul is the same way He will also reveal it to us. The work of God is the task that someone is currently engaged in, their position in society, in their family, in a body of Christ. There is no need for anyone to tell them otherwise. If there is an encouragement or exhortation, it is for those who may be facing challenges in whatever task they’re currently undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us &lt;u&gt;all things&lt;/u&gt;? (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things. Including serving God.&lt;/p&gt;
