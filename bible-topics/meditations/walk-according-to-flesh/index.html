    <h3 id="walk-according-to-the-flesh">1. Walk According to the Flesh</h3>

    <div>
<p>
<img alt="" src="/images/walking.jpg" style="border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 136px; padding: 0px; float: left;" />
The traditional interpretation is "Walk according to the flesh" means the action or lifestyle that falls outside the commonly accepted set of Christian behaviors. This article attempts to show that such interpretation is inconsistent with what is being communicated by the apostle Paul; as a matter of fact, He wrote the entire book of Romans to show "Walk according to the flesh" is not about sinning or living a worldly lifestyle, but about the attempt to use the means of the flesh to serve God, or to maintain a relationship with Him.
</p>
</div>

    <p>We find the expression “Walk according to the flesh” in Romans 8:4:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>1</sup> There is therefore now <u>no condemnation</u> for those who are in Christ Jesus.  <sup>2</sup> <span style="color: #ff0000;">For the <u>law of the life-giving Spirit</u> in Christ Jesus has set you free from the <u>law of sin and death</u></span>. <sup>3</sup> For God achieved what the law could not do because it was weakened through the flesh. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,  <sup>4</sup> so that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>walk according to the flesh</u></span> but according to the Spirit. <cite>Romans 8:1-4</cite></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In verse 1, Paul quickly proclaimed without a disclaimer or a fine print that a Christian will never be under condemnation again. How can this be true? It is true because Christ has set us free from the condemning law by the power of the superior law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ. In order to put the “walk according to the flesh” in context, we must identify and know where we stand in relation to these laws.</p>

    <h3 id="two-kinds-of-law">2. Two Kinds of Law</h3>

    <p>Verse 2 shows us there are two kinds of law:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The law of sin and death, and</li>
      <li>The law of the Spirit of life</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s obvious from Paul’s writing that a Christian cannot straddle between the two laws, like a slave cannot serve two masters, or a citizen of two kingdoms. We are to be transitioned from one law to another, and we should not look back like Lot’s wife who became a pillar of salt (Genesis 19:26). Let’s review the purposes of these two types of laws.</p>

    <h4 id="a-the-law-of-sin-and-death">a. The Law of Sin and Death</h4>

    <p>Once when we still walked in darkness, we were condemned sinners living under the law of sin and death —the commandments and statutes. <u>This law governs our flesh</u>; it punishes us when we sin. The law of sin and death was in effect under the Old Covenant relationship between man and God.</p>

    <h5 id="i-the-old-covenants-sacrificial-system">i. The Old Covenant’s Sacrificial System</h5>

    <p>Since mankind cannot stop sinning, God provided a <u>temporary relief</u> through the sacrificial system and other methods of cleansing to meet the requirement of the law: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die” (Ezekiel 18:20).</p>

    <p>But are these sacrifices enough to make men right before God? No, they are only shadows of the real sacrifice when Christ comes. They only provide a ceremonial cleansing of the flesh only to be repeated over and over again, while the blood of Christ achieves an everlasting cleansing of the conscience from the guilt of sin.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>13</sup>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the <u>cleansing of the flesh</u>, <sup>14</sup>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, <u>cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</u> (Hebrews 9:13-14)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And contrary to traditional belief, the law does not bridge the deep chasm between man and God, but its main purpose is to show how far we have fallen, it shows the reason why we are apart from God:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>For <u>no one</u> is declared righteous before him by the works of the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin. <cite>(Romans 3:20)</cite></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h5 id="b-the-modern-sacrificial-system">b. The Modern Sacrificial System</h5>

    <p>Though the Cross of Christ is supposed to supercede the Old Covenant’s sacrificial system, modern Christians, due to their lack of understanding, continued the obsolete and ineffective system in different forms.</p>

    <p>The Galatians with their obsession with circumcision to which Paul had to express his strongest warning. This system though started with God, it has become artificial as God Has obsoleted it in Christ.</p>

    <p class="blockquote">Listen! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, <u>Christ will be of no benefit to you at all</u>! <cite>(Galatians 5:2)</cite></p>

    <p>The Colossians with myriad rules and regulations that they used to make themselves more spiritual. They commit the same fatal errors as many well meaning Christians do today. They should heed Paul’s warning that any attempt to use any means, other than the simple faith in the Cross of Christ, to draw near to God deserves “anathema.” To the Colossians Paul also wrote:</p>

    <p class="blockquote"><sup>20</sup>If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why do you submit to them as though you lived in the world? <sup>21</sup>“Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!” <sup>22</sup>These are all destined to perish with use, founded as they are on human commands and teachings. <sup>23</sup>Even though they have the <u>appearance of wisdom</u> with their <u>self-imposed worship and false humility</u> achieved by an unsparing treatment of the body – <u>a wisdom with no true value</u> – they in reality result in fleshly indulgence. <cite>(Colossians 2:20-23)</cite></p>

    <p>What about us, Christians of the 21<sup>st</sup> century? <b>Confessions?</b>—lip service at best because no one can ever confess all their sins—because according to James 2:10, missing one sin is the same thing as missing all. A show of <b>remorse?</b> <b>Money</b> in the offering plate? Physical <b>punishments?</b> <b>Fasting?</b> <b>Deprivation</b> of senses? <b>Sacrifices of praise?</b>—King David may have said it but he is not God; because only Jesus can be the worthy sacrifice in the sight of God. These are all pseudo sacrifices nonetheless; and they compete with the Cross of Christ.</p>

    <p>While the provisions in the Old Covenant were provided by God as a temporary solution for sins, the self-prescribed methods New Covenant Christians invented are but products of the flesh, invented by men. Remember “strange fire” offered to God in the Old Testament which provoked such God’s wrath? Anything that attempts to circumvent God’s provision is met with divine wrath (Leviticus 10:1). The story of Uzzah in 2 Samuel 6:6 and Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:1-11. Uzzah thought God needed a hand, while Ananias and Sapphira wanted to earn God’s favor (or perhaps man?) instead of faith in Christ. Had they not given any of their proceed, they would not have sinned against God, but their sin was much more grievious because they did not give from faith (Romans 14:23).</p>

    <p>Man-made sacrifice is an abomination in the sight of God because He demands nothing less than the Perfect Sacrifice.</p>

    <p>And what about the system under the Old Covenant that God had ordained? Even God had planned that it had to become obsolete as we read in Hebrews 8:13:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear. <cite>Hebrews 8:13</cite></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This leads us to a new law, one that can give life.</p>

    <h4 id="b-the-law-of-the-spirit-of-life">b. The Law of the Spirit of Life</h4>

    <p>Despite the fact that the apostle Paul wrote extensively to hopefully open the eyes of the church to this new law, all they see is still the law of the Old Covenant which Paul calls the <u>law of sin and death</u>. The new law that came with the New Covenant forces people to make a matter-of-life-or-death choice: either you live under the new law or the old one, not both. In Romans 7, Paul gave an analogy of a woman who must die to the old husband before she can remarry. Christ died to give us this death so we may be released from the law of sin and death in order to be joined to Him. To try to have a relationship with both is to commit spiritual adultery.</p>

    <p>The old law requires absolute obedience to a set of rules and statutes with temporary relief in the event of inevitable failures. What does the new law require? It also requires absolute obedience but no longer of rules and regulations, but of faith or trust in the finished work of Christ. What does this entail? This faith in Christ can be expressed this way:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">There is no good work I do that can make me right with God, and neither there is any bad deed that I do that can take away this right standing with Him. I must trust that Jesus had paid it all&mdash;past, present, and future.</p>

    <p>Does any Christian dare to embrace this belief? Or are you afraid that there is something so powerful that can take away the total forgiveness of sin by the Cross of Christ? Something that can make Christ’s death an unfinished business?</p>

    <p>This new law requires only one thing: your faith. Because faith is the only thing God accepts—<em>“The just shall live by faith”</em> <cite>(Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11, Hebrews 10:38)</cite>. And faith is the only “works” that God accepts. And the only works that believers can do.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>28</sup>Therefore they said to Him, “What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?” <sup>29</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, “<u>This is the <strong>work</strong> of God, that you <strong>believe</strong> in Him whom He has sent</u>.” <cite>(John 6:28-29)</cite></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Therefore the work of the New Covenant Christian is not works that come from flesh, but it is the work of believing. If God assigns him a task, like leading the people out of Egypt, or go preach to the people of Nineveh, the task is not work, but a job that God has called him to do. It does not get him into heaven, and neither can he refuse it because who can resist the God who send? God sent Moses and Jonah and off they went. God will not accept any works other than the work of believing, because the only work that counts is the cross of Christ, everything else from sinful man is but filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).</p>

    <h3 id="walk-according-to-the-spirit">3. Walk According to the Spirit</h3>

    <p>So we have seen a study in contrast between the two kinds of law:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>An Old Covenant based law, which Paul calls the law of sin and death, that governs our flesh, that deals with things we do or do not do, and punish us upon failures.</li>
      <li>A New Covenant based law  that requires only one thing: faith. No more. No less. Any addition to it is forbidden. In other words, trusting in no one else but Christ.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It should have become rather clear that no part of the flesh is involved in walking according to the Spirit. The question then is how can one express the command to walk according to the Spirit? No, you cannot express it in any way except to keep believing. Paul exhorts us to keep fixing our eyes on Christ, the beginning and the completion of your faith (Hebrews 12:2). The Hebrews in the desert must fix their eyes on the bronze snake (Numbers 21:9; John 3:14). Peter to fix his eyes on Jesus when he walked on the raging waves (Matthew 14:29-30).</p>

    <p>That is how we walk according to the Spirit.</p>

    <h3 id="conclusion">4. Conclusion</h3>

    <p>Let’s consider this passage where Nicodemus came to see Jesus one evening:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>1</sup>Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; <sup>2</sup>this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.” <sup>3</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is <u>born again</u> he cannot see the kingdom of God.” (John 3:1-3)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Without waiting for Nicodemus to come up with a real question, Jesus gave an answer which must have taken him by surprise. Nicodemus must have come to Jesus that evening with the same question asked by his contemporaries in John 6:28, “What must we <u>DO</u> to accomplish the deeds God requires?” To these Jesus’ answer was simply: <u>FAITH</u>, <u>to believe</u> in the One God has sent. It’s faith, not works. It’s believing, not doing.</p>

    <p>Nicodemus approaches relationship with God the same way Christians do today. We always immediately think of what we should “do” from the standpoint of the flesh. What Jesus said amounts to “Don’t even try. There is nothing you do that can help get you in the kingdom of God. You don’t need physical prowess, but spiritual rebirth.” Then Jesus gave the reason why: “What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit <cite>(John 3:6)</cite>”. Therefore you should no longer evaluate your standing before God based on the products of your flesh, be they good or bad deeds.</p>

    <p>I’ve often heard conflicting exhortation to prove my faith with some works, and then an exact opposing exhortation to not rely on my own strength. What? What am I supposed to do? Dammed if I do, damned if I don’t. All these conflicting teachings lead to a very frustrating Christian experience. Imagine this frustrated Christian, loaded with guilt, trying to share their faith with others. It’s easy for the person being evangelized to spot inconsistencies in testimonies they heard. They needed rest for their weary soul, they sensed laborious struggle to get right with God. They needed relief for their sin sicked souls, they sensed much guilt in the countenance of the disciples. They needed to be loved, they couldn’t sense it from the one who’s supposed to know personally the love of God.</p>

    <p>This is because the Christian in question is walking according to the flesh. They try to use their works to prove their worthiness. They still live under the law that Christ should have already set them free from. They still worry about many what-if’s. Their relationship with God is hung by a thin thread. One more sin and God will let them go. In theory they have received Christ as their Savior, in reality they have no assurance of their salvation. The flesh is still the determining factor in their salvation.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, walking according to the Spirit is simply this: rest in the fact that Christ had paid it all on the Cross. This rest is the work that is pleasing to God, and is the only work accepted by God.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Thus we must make every effort to enter that <u>rest</u>, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of <u>disobedience</u>. <cite>Hebrews 4:11</cite></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>… where the true obedience is to trust in nothing else but the cross of Christ, and this rest we can enter because Christ’s work is finished. This rest is the true Sabbath when the believer can quit all struggle in trying to get right with God and simply lay down at the foot of the old rugged cross.</p>

    <p>Can you see now “Walk According to the Flesh” is not about sins and transgressions, but about using the flesh in an exercise in futility to get right with God? That this flesh based attempt is a rebellion, the “pattern of disobedience” that the author of Hebrews wrote about?</p>
