    <p>Once again, I thank God for the desire to delve into God’s Word that seems to be continuing, and the feeling I have about the Scriptures is so different from the years, or perhaps the decades, that followed the first readings of the paraphrased New Testament that led me to the life changing verse John 8:58: “Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.” Believe it or not, I can still recall clearly the joy that began to flow in my heart, that led me to the place where I knelt down in MS Hiền’s living room, soon after he moved into the Sunset, to receive Christ as my Savior and Lord. How old were you then, Andrew (our current young pastor, MS Hiền’s son)?</p>

    <p>But not long afterward, in spite of all the best intention and the desire to please and serve the God that I had settled in my heart that He was the one true God, works, or legalism, slowly crept back. My Christian walk was getting heavier. Witnessing trips to the Tenderloin did not give any more meaning to my new found faith, or restored any of the initial joy. I believe all these decades could well be described in this verse: “What has happened to all your joy?” in Galatians 4:15 when Paul raised to them this question.</p>

    <p>The recent renewal of God’s grace in my heart has led me through many paths as I google’d for the answer to the question that started it all: “Why is it so difficult for Christian to live by grace?”, I suddenly found a renewed interest in book reading all over again. But this time it’s different. I’m not reading to learn any thing new. But I’m looking for precious few writers that are my kindred spirits. To feel less lonely. To find a confirmation that we can believe, and live out the belief, that without faith—as opposed to works—it is impossible to please God.</p>

    <p>I discovered Francis Schaeffer, and his book True Spirituality in particular. This book was recommended by Joel Borofsky of http://thechristianwatershed.com when I consulted him on the Mark Scandrette phenomenon. I would like to share with you some of what he wrote—way better than what I’ve trying to say in many emails—which I believe may help our walk with Christ a little easier with more spring in our steps.</p>

    <p class="blockquote">Book: True Spirituality<br />
Author: Francis Schaeffer, founder of L'Abri<br />
Section: Freedom now from the bond of sin<br />
Chapter: Salvation Past-Future-Present<br /><br />

Page 78-79<br />

"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandment: and his commandments are not grievous" (! John 5:3,4).  Is that true? In ourselves, do we find that his commandments are not grievous? For many years as a pastor, preaching the gospel, I never preached on this verse for the simple reason that I did not understand it. I found the commandments of God grievous; I could hardly bear them. And then one day, as I was wrestling with this topic, I saw that all one had to do was to look at the immediate context: "And this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. Because whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world." Fortunately it does not stop there, or it would not tell us the "how." "And this is the victory that overcometh the world, our faith." On the basis of the finished work of Christ, a moment-by-moment life of faith is "the victory." Not our victory, but Christ's victory, purchased for us on Calvary's cross, laid hold of moment by moment in faith.</p>

    <p>Pay attention to the emphasis on the word “faith”. In a very beautiful way Francis Schaeffer tried to warn us of the danger of  the mixing up of faith in ourselves and faith in Christ’s finished work in the cross. Then he went on to show the similarity between salvation and sanctification.</p>

    <p class="blockquote">Sanctification and assurance are comparable. A man may be saved and not know he is saved because he does not raise the empty hands of faith at this particular moment and believe God's promises.  And a man may lack in sanctification all that God means him to have in the present life because even though Christ has purchased it for him upon the cross he fails to believe God at this place and raise the empty hands of faith moment by moment.  Now let me repeat, to be absolutely clear about it, the basis is not your faith; it is the finished work of Christ. Faith is the instrument to receive this thing from God that Christ has purchased for us.</p>

    <p>This is similar to how Abraham was counted as righteous before God because he believed God (Galatians 3:6). Note that the basis of his being credited as righteous was not his actions, because if it was based on them he should not have been counted as righteous. He failed to wait upon God and took his maidservant Hagar—if this is not a major failure I don’t know what else is. He lied to king Abimelech that Sarah was his sister. And I’m sure there are many unwritten incidents of his failure to trust God but these are the most well known one. God used imperfect Abraham to demolish any notion that there is anything from us, besides faith, that can please Him. He was called righteous because he believed God.</p>

    <p>We are saved because we believed in Christ’s finished work on the cross. We are perfect, perfect in holiness, perfect in sanctification, again because we believed in Christ’s finished work on the cross. There is no part from salvation to sanctification that is ours, except for our believing in Him. Now isn’t this liberating? Isn’t this grace? Isn’t this what Martin Luther discovered when he uttered “The just shall live by faith” upon reading Habakkuk?</p>

    <p>Francis Schaeffer continued to further clarify this point through the rest of the chapter but I think this is enough for now. So the core of the message is this, that Jesus has accomplished it all on the cross, from saving us for eternity, to full unblemished sanctification—continual cleansing even as we occasionally fall as we still sin in our fleshly bodies (some cults actually believe that a true Christian cannot sin anymore)—so we might be presented before the Father at His second coming, all we have to do is believe, to have faith, or as Schaeffer puts it: to raise the empty hands of faith moment by moment. So the focus of a Christian is no longer in the negative: avoid sinning at all cost, but in the positive: receiving the gift of perfect holiness and ask God how we can best serve Him. According to Roman 7:8, the more a Christian is focused on observing the law, by avoid sinning at all cost, the more he sins: “But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.” (by Christ’s death we are no longer married to the law, but instead we became the bride of Christ—Romans 7:4). 1 Corinthians 15:56 reiterates this very clearly: “The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.” But sadly, many Christians fall into the trap of thinking that the law can produce holiness, or assist in the sanctification process, but instead it only condemns and points us to Christ.</p>

    <p>Jesus has accomplished for us everything from a total forgiveness to a life that is pleasing to God, and that will be our message to the world, as it is written: <span class="green-letter">“He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?” (Romans 8:32)</span></p>
