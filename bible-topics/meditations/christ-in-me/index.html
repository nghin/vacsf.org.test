    <p>In this letter, I’m going to present another argument trying to convince the readers that the only way that works, and pleases God, is the way of grace. I was so thrilled to have stumbled upon Hebrews 8, which seems to help me nail once for all in its coffin, obedience to the Law as a way of life. I hope you will, at least this time ignore all my previous writings, but follow this thesis with an open mind.  I promise to be gentle, and will not deviate from the theme. Let’s read this passage, and please focus on the underlined text:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>1</sup> Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, <sup>2</sup> and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being.
<sup>3</sup> Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. <sup>4</sup> If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. <sup>5</sup> They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”[a] <sup>6</sup> But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.
<u><sup>7</sup> For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.</u> <sup>8</sup> But God found fault with the people and said[b]:
“The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a <u>new covenant</u> with the people of Israel   and with the people of Judah.
<u><sup>9</sup> It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors</u> when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord.
<u><sup>10</sup> This is the covenant</u> I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. <u>I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts</u>. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
<u><sup>11</sup> No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.</u>
<sup>12 </sup>For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”[c]
<sup>13 </sup>By calling this covenant “new,” <u>he has made the first one obsolete</u>; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Let’s walk slowly through these verses as they contain all the ingredients I need for my argument. Verses 1 through 7 sets the stage for the need of a new covenant. Verse 9 emphatically says that it will be DIFFERENT from the old covenant. And the difference is in this way: God will DIRECTLY writes his laws in the hearts and minds of the people (verse 10), and they DO NOT need anyone to remind them that they should know, or love, the Lord, because by His authoritative word: they all shall know Him (verse 11).</p>

    <p class="blockquote gray">Notes: Know the Lord = γνῶθι τὸν κύριον, with γνῶθι=recognition of a stranger, and εἰδήσουσιν=absolute acquaintance as of one born under God's covenant. (Vincent's Word Studies). Absolute acquaintance. I think this should meet the requirement of Love the Lord with all your heart, mind, and soul.</p>

    <p>Of all commandments, I don’t worry much about the 10 commandments, because no one can fulfill even even a single command. But it’s the love commandment that bothered me the most: ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’  I don’t know about you, I find it a devastating and fuzzy commandment. Peter knew it and he avoided answering Jesus’ question like a plague.  I know I can’t even fulfill 1 millionth of what it probably means, if I will ever know what it means. Therefore upon discovering Hebrews 8 I feel such a sense of relief, because God Himself guarantees that I will KNOW Him, the knowing that encompasses the love implied in the commandment, at the absolute acquaintance level. I love this new covenant, and Hebrews 8. It really gives me a way out of years of uncertainty as I walk with Him.</p>

    <p>Let’s backtrack to the garden of Eden where once walked the first family, no sin, no guilt, no commandments to keep, no need to offer sacrifices. But the inner desire to be God’s equal was great. So they partook of the fruit from the wrong tree. They thought eating from this tree will open their eyes, they would know the difference between good and evil, and they would become like God.</p>

    <p>We have read this story many times over but all we saw was this disobedience to God, we like to use the monkey-got-caught-in-a-cookie-jar example, and we wrote the hymn “Trust and Obey”. We failed to see the theological implication of this action, of the newly acquired ability to differentiate between good and evil. This knowledge implied that though God had not introduced the 10 commandments, the Law appeared as a result of Adam and Eve’s sin, as every time Adam and Eve had a notion of something good or something evil, this Law is at work.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law [the 10 commandments and statutes given to the Jews], do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.” (Romans 2:14-15)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I hope you see the connection: the desire to have the knowledge of good and evil, is also the desire to be led by the Law. Because it is the Law that informs them of what is good, and what is evil. It brought them death, instead of life. This desire to be led by the Law was also manifested when Israel wanted a King instead of being led by God. And they got King Saul. All the sins that man commits are but byproducts of this original sin, most abhorred by God: the sin of spiritual adultary, of wanting to be guided by the Law instead of God.</p>

    <p>Jesus had no problem with the Law because He is its author.  The Law describes God’s character and attributes. It’s perfect, and it existed even before time. But it’s only a shadow of the real thing: God. It tells us of God, but it’s not God. He had problems with us worshiping the Law instead of trusting in Him. Adam and Eve committed this very sin of trusting the Law, which gives them the knowledge of good and evil, instead of trusting in God.</p>

    <p>The Law is like a very sharp knife, or a hair triggered gun, while we are like little children who cannot handle such instruments. The Bible has numerous passages that shows that the obedience to the Law does nothing to reduce sins or bring about righteousness. These are just a few examples:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. (1 Corinthians 15:56)</p>

    <p class="blockquote">So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God. For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death. But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code. (Romans 7:4-6)</p>

    <p class="blockquote">"<sup>10 </sup>All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law."<sup>11 </sup>Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because, "The righteous will live by faith."<sup>12 </sup>The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, "The man who does these things will live by them."<sup>13 </sup>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree."4 (Galatians 3:10-13)</p>

    <p class="blockquote">What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "Do not covet." But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead. (Romans 7:7-8)</p>

    <p>For a long time, since I started writing these articles, I’m sure some of you might think that I’m for abolishing the Law. No, I’m only advocating we have gone about fulfilling its requirements in all the wrong way. Jesus said He didn’t come to abolish the Law, but He came to fulfill it, every jot and tittle. But here is where most of you missed, especially the second part: He fulfilled the requirement of the Law of sin and death by dying on the cross to bring us righteousness, and He fulfilled the requirement of the Law of the Spirit of Life by living the best life possible through us once we are saved by believing in Jesus. Once again let’s read from Hebrews 8:10-11.</p>

    <p class="blockquote"><sup>10</sup> This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. <sup>11</sup> No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. <sup>12</sup> For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”</p>

    <p>So even the fine command like Matthew 22:37, “Love the Lord your God …”, or “know the Lord” in Hebrews 8:11, it can only be carried out by the Perfect Jesus as promised by God Himself. If we, no matter how well intentioned, attempt to externalize this command by waving it in front of our brothers and sisters in Christ, won’t we disobey Hebrews 8, and won’t we commit the very deadly sin of Adam and Eve?</p>

    <p>We must trust the Holy Spirit of God to work in the lives of the believers and let go of the need to the need to control the flock by guiding them with laws, commandments, codes, rules, regulations, do’s and don’ts. Even common sense teaches us that rule-based upbringing destroys true relationship. So does the law in the lives of Christians; it will prevent you from being able to truly love God, and it will prevent you from being able to trust Him. Do you find this to be true in deep physical intimacy? Any suggestion of a rule will take away the ability to completely surrender oneself to the moment. Relationship with God is like that, like the Song of Solomon which describes God and His beloved.</p>

    <p>But the law is not just limitted to the ten commandments, or the whole Mosaic law system, it’s whatever that you believe may put a wedge between you and God (Romans 2:14). The morbid introspection caused by the observances of these unwritten laws in your conscience is even more powerful than the spelled out ten commandments; they can wreck your relationship with God. There is a better law in your heart, one that is heaven friendly, the law of the spirit of life (Romans 8:2). This new law afforded us by the new covenant takes our eyes off of ourselves and allow us to fix them on Christ instead.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” (Colossians 1:27)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>May God’s grace give you the courage to leave the Law as your guide, and simply trust in Jesus, in the deposit of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, as He promised: He will ensure you become God’s absolute acquaintance - εἰδήσουσιν, He will fulfill the command that scares the heck out of me, to Love God in a way beyond my comprehension. That is grace. Can you feel it? I hope you can feel the joy that is welling up in me at this point when I ponder … Christ in me, the hope of glory.</p>
