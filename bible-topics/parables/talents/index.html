In this writing, I'm attempting to prove that the conventional interpretation of it is a misinterpretation, and is exactly what Jesus had said about why He uses parables: so that the hearer may hear and not understand, may see and not perceive. When you use your flesh to understand Jesus' parables, or to carry out God's will, you won't understand it, because it is a mystery (Mat 13:10-11). But if we look beyond the mere superficial meaning, we will really understand what Jesus had in mind when he told this parable. A mis-interpretation, or mis-application of it will cause a believer to try to produce fruit for death (Rom 7:5), fruit that were initiated from the flesh which is aroused by the law. Which one of you reader knows exactly how many talents they were given and how many you think you can produce? Don't guess, because either you do, or you don't. If you don't guess about what it it takes for you to go to heaven, don't guess about your talent production quota either. What have you done with your talents?

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>14</sup>“For it is like a man going on a journey, who summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them. <sup>14</sup>To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. <sup>16</sup>The one who had received five talents went off right away and put his money to work and gained five more. <sup>17</sup>In the same way, the one who had two gained two more. <sup>18</sup>But the one who had received one talent went out and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money in it. <sup>19</sup>After a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled his accounts with them. … <sup>30</sup>And throw that worthless slave (the one that buried his talent) into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ (Matthew 25:14-30—NET Bible).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>What is the traditional interpretation, or application, do we generally draw from this parable? Here it is: better use your talent or else the Lord will take it away; be careful or you might be thrown into outer darkness, losing your salvation; so go on and do your best, and make sure you don’t commit the terrible error of burying your talent.</p>

    <p>If this parable is indeed for Christians, and must be taken at face value, I doubt very much if any one can produce talents matching what given by the Lord; simply because no one knows exactly how many they were given, or even what, or whether the talents that they presume to produce can meet the Lord’s standard of perfection.</p>

    <p>In the same method I employed when I wrote an essay on the Parable of the Sower, I will again use the same framework upon which we can interpret this parable:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Rule #1: All are equally dead in sin and trespasses (Rom 3:10-11, Rom 3:23; I Jn 1:8,10).</li>
      <li>Rule #2: All are equally unable to do God’s will: to produce talents (Jn 3:6; Rom 7:18; 1 Corinthians 15:50).</li>
      <li>Rule #3: Based on Rule #1 and Rule #2, you’re either saved or unsaved, but no classes of Christians, because none can produce even a single talent (Mt 20:8; James 2:10; Jn 3:18).</li>
      <li>Rule #4: People cannot produce talents, only Christ can</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I expounded on these rules rather thoroughly in the Parable of the Sower. I will assume that you have no problems with these rules as I continue to explain how this parable can be understood.</p>

    <p>Note that Jesus gave the scenario of someone given 5 talents, produced another 5, someone given 2, produced exactly 2. Why didn’t He say anything about someone given 10, but missed one? or anywhere in between? Might the one who missed a single one after producing 999,999 out of a million talents be treated as one who was given only one and missed it? Will God allow anything less than perfection: if you’re given a million talents, better produce a million in return, and not a single one is allowed to be missed?</p>

    <p>Worse yet, in a similar parable in Luke 19:12-27, each of the ten servants was given a mina, a servant produced 10 minas from one that was given him. What if he produced 9, or 5, or 1, or he worked hard but actually lost it due to a reversal of fortune? How do you know your effort meets the Lord’s expectation?</p>

    <p>Are you, the best of Christians, you preach on the radio and write books, are you sure you have produced in keeping with the talents given you? If you think you are something, let me assure you that you are not (Galatians 6:3). I’ll give you proof that God demands nothing less than perfection.</p>

    <p>“So then, be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” (Mat 5:48)
“For the one who obeys the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.” (James 2:10)
“And I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.” (Galatians 5:3)
“Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: ‘Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy’.” (Lev 19:2)
“You must be blameless before the LORD your God.” (Deu 18:13)</p>

    <p>When Jesus said: I give you 5 talents, produce 5, and when I give you 2, likewise give me back another 2, He meant it. The Word that spoke the world into existence does not say something that we can take lightly. He did not say you can produce less than what was given. He did not say given 5 you can produce 4.</p>

    <p>So exactly how many talents did you, preachers and teachers, produce for God? Before you can presume to teach others about serving God, have you done your job to the full extent your Lord requires of you? Of all preachers I’ve heard, I believe Billy Graham is one among precious few who can avoid answering this question, because he never plays the role of a teacher, pretending to teach in place of Jesus, but he is faithfully serving as an ambassador, someone who simply points others to Christ.</p>

    <p>Even if I were to go no further, any attempt to apply this parable, using a faulty interpretation, in a Christian life would prove futile; the Christian will never be sure of their standing when The Lord returns. And no one should prepare themselves for God’s Kingdom without knowing the full status of their citizenship.</p>

    <p>Jesus said it many times in the gospel, and in different ways, and Paul reiterated it in I Cor 15, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. To inherit the kingdom of God, the “old man” must die before he can be born again; but how? Paul said that the old man, the body of death, clung to him like a siamese twins. And yet, Colossians 2:12, Romans 6:4, Galatians 3:27, all have claimed that we were counted as dead and buried with Christ. The demand is that we must die, and Christ did it for us.</p>

    <p>What about the demand that we are to produce talents? Wouldn’t it make sense that Christ does it for us, too? Or are you so prideful to say you’re producing talents?</p>

    <p>In Matthew 7:19, Jesus said you must bear fruit, otherwise you’d be cut off and thrown in the fire. But how can a man bear fruit if it is fruit of the Spirit? (Galatians 5:22); unless of course you think bearing fruit means doing something in the name of Christ? This was not what Jesus said about how to bear fruit. He said you bear fruit by being in Him; He didn’t say do something and you’ll get the fruit.</p>

    <p>How are you “in Christ?” By doing something? If this is what you think then somebody is not teaching you the right gospel. You can feed a thousand poor and preach the gospel to tens of thousands, you may still be out of Christ (1 Cor 13). What that gets you in Christ, in God’s family, is whether God thinks you are a righteous man. How do you become a righteous man? By God’s grace and through your faith in Him. The Bible says a thousand times (I exaggerated) that no amount of work, even obedience to all of the law, can give you the righteousness of God.</p>

    <p>Once again, God says: bear fruit, and He did it so He may freely give it to those that believe in Him. Talents and fruit, Jesus does it all to give to those that belong to Him, just as He gave Himself as a sacrifice on the cross to give it freely as the ransom to redeem your souls.</p>

    <p>In Matthew 5:48, Jesus expects us to be perfect because God is perfect, and then He went ahead to shed the ever cleansing blood to freely give perfection to those that call on His name. Can you through any act of consecration, rituals, self sacrifices, make you perfect?</p>

    <p>So you can’t produce talents, you can’t bear fruit, you can’t die to yourself, you can’t be perfect, and using the rules I made up earlier, you can’t do anything that pleases God. I hope by now you understand what Jesus was implying when He gave this parable: apart from me you cannot do anything. To the Hebrews, He said: replace your burnt sacrifices with Me, to the Gentiles He said: Come unto Me. Then you will have talents, talents not from wretched you, but from the Author of Creation. And not one talent for another, but all that God will give you along with His Son, the One He gave out of the riches of His grace.</p>

    <p>Don’t try to understand this parable by itself, but put it in relationship with other foundational truths so you don’t arrive at wrong conclusion and have doubts about the all sufficiency of the Cross of Christ. God expects nothing less than Work performed by the only One in whom He is well pleased: Almighty God. Your work? Your talents? Filthy rags. The prophet Isaiah would say the same of your (self-) righteous deeds (Isaiah 64:6). Be careful, because Jesus only accepts talents that come from Himself. When He tells you to “bring me the talents,” He meant: only by believing in Me.</p>
