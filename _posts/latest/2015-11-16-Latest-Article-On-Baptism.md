All too often, when we Christians have been taught a view dealing with an important Bible issue, we form an immediate position that is nearly impossible to change later. This is especially true for baptism where just a very few Scriptures are used to support each of the vastly different teachings. To understand what God wants us to know regarding this important subject, we should listen to all that He has to say about it. This section attempts to present a more complete picture of baptism. It points out the historical roots; considers the specific audiences to which the messengers were sent; and identifies where baptism fits into our Christian lives.
