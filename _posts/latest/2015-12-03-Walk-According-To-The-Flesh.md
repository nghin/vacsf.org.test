teaser: "The verse that contains the phrase \"Walk according to the flesh\" appears almost exactly in the middle of the book of Romans. It's not by chance, but by design, that this verse appears here. Its true meaning is missed by virtually all major commentaries."

The traditional interpretation of the phrase "Walk according to the flesh" is the action or lifestyle that falls outside the commonly accepted set of behaviors. This article attempts to show that is not the meaning communicated by the apostle Paul; as a matter of fact, He wrote the entire book of Romans to show the "Walk according to the flesh" is not about sinning, but about using the means of the flesh to get right with God.
