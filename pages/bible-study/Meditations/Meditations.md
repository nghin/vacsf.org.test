      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/ambassador/">Parable of the Ambassador</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/baptism/">Baptism</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

A more complete picture of baptism. This article points out the historical roots; considers the specific audiences to which the messengers were sent; and identifies where baptism fits into our Christian lives.

      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/rewards/">Rewards - Phần Thưởng Trên Trời</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

Are there degrees of rewards in heaven? This article will show that the very idea is a worldly one, but it is at the core of work-based religion <span style="font-style: italic; color: #ff0000;">(bài này có tiếng Việt)</span>

</p></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/christ-in-me/">The Hope of Glory</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

The 10 commandments, the law, works, grace ... how are we to live? Perhaps this article doesn't even need to be written. All the answers are found in the studies of Romans and Galatians.

      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/sanctification/">Sanctification</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

An overwhelming majority in Christendom believes that sanctification is a process. This article attempts to show that it is not a process, but a gift. This belief system satisfies the self-centered desire for self exaltation. The believers are not to focus on themselves but to fix their eyes on Christ.

      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/the-cycle/">The Faith-Salvation-Work Cycle</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

The dangerous cycle based on circular reasoning what wrecks lives of those naively follow it. Salvation is based on faith in Christ with no strings attached, no small prints, no disclaimers. As dangerous as it is, like the little yeast of the Pharisees that can spoil the whole batch of dough, it is widely accepted and taught everywhere.

      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/lukewarm/">Laodicea, are you lukewarm?</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

This article will show that the commonly accepted interpretation of lukewarmness is unbiblical, it tends to be used as a scare tactic to keep believers in line. There is a correct interpretation of it that is based entirely on foundational truths found in the Bible.
